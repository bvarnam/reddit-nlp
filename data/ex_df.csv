j_d0tnet,1631248750,ple5nz,"Disclaimer: I did see a previous question touching on something like this but what I'm confused about was NOT addressed so hopefully this is allowed.

They say that the surface area volume ratio limits how big things can grow because surface area scales as a square while volume scales as a cube, so the ratio of volume to surface area goes up as you get bigger. Fair enough. BUT: how is this not just a matter of what units you're using?

For example, a 1x1x1 ft cube has a surface area to volume ratio of 6sq. Ft to 1 cubic foot, so 6:1. A 1x1x1 meter cube has a ratio of 6:1 too but the units are meters. Couldn't you always define your units so that you have a 6:1 ratio with any size of cube?

To bring it back to the actual question, wouldn't your ratio be essentially the same no matter how big your object is? Imagine you expanded everything in the universe by the same amount but kept your unit of measurement the same, you wouldn't suddenly hit some limit where it stops working right? Does it have something to do with the size of molecules and proteins etc? Please help I am so confused",explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Seriously, WTF is up with surface area and volume limiting how big things can grow??"

As I learnt from online sources, we make an experiment with creating two particles from the same source for example a positron and its equivalent electron. We for sure know that they both add up to the original particle (-1) + (+1) = 0 or spins are the same in total. One right one lefty.

We separate them faaar far apart and then observe one, if we find out that one is spinning left at that point, we for sure know the other one is spinning right. We just got information from a distance far apart faster then light-speed. Thus creating a paradox. If this understanding is wrong please correct me and if correct please tell me why:

I can say two person that I love one as romantically and one as a friend they both know this beforehand and I write a letter to each one of them and give them also tell them to open my letters when they go home at the exact same time. They go their homes and read the letters once one find out that I am just friends/love them they know exactly at that point the other person's situation, they just got information faster than speed.

2nd: I woke up one day two weeks ago and my left arm was completely numb and I had mild chest pain.  I thought it was serious, in fact I panicked a bit. And then I went on-line and scared myself with some google search seld-diagnosis just to confirm my thoughts it was serious. 

Even so- I debated for 3 days as it got worse if it was serious enough to go. The reason I debated was because of my stupid deductible.  $300 to see the doctor on top of the $500 I pay a month.  And I can barely make rent. I know the health insurance industry is solely about $$$.  I don't need to be explained that.

3rd: What I want explained is WHY are we using a health coverage model that forces average citizens unqualified to diagnose 99.999% of anything medical to decide if something is serious enough to warrant a doctor's visit?! And even more likely to simply not go even if it may be serious because they can't afford to?

To me it looks like put option can only be used for hedging but not to make any profit. It looks like a zero sum game to me.

Here is how I see it. For the sake of easiness, let’s neglect premium and transaction costs.

2) apple share drops to 40usd.
3) exercise put option
4) you are now back at your starting position and have 50usd in your hands. Profit? None.

So why do people say buying put options can be profitable? I do understand that call options can be profitable:

1) current price of apple stock is 50 usd. buy call option for apple at strike price 50 usd. Do NOT buy an apple stock

It said that the environment can lower IQ, but it doesn't really increase it all that much beyond the max intelligence level the person can get. 

For example, you can start out with average intelligence and end up with below average intelligence at the age of 10 due to neglect. However you cannot start out with average intelligence and end up gifted later. Later in life, once you're fully developed you cannot do anything at all to change your intelligence level. However you can do things to make it drop (ie concussions, drug use, brain damage, dementia, etc).  **In other words it's easier to drop your IQ by 20 points as compared to raising it by 20 points.** 

However what stumps me is what genes are involved in intelligence, as well as what genes do in the process of brain development. I am also curious about how genes affect intelligence in general.

Now assuming the flight was full (335 seats) and everyone wanted to offset their emissions and used one of these calculators, even the lowest website result (0.6t -ICAO) would mean that the CO2 emissions for everyone on the flight were 201t. On the other end of the scale using the 2.2t from Atmosfair, it would be a whopping 737t!

But... the entire fuel burn is only 78t for the flight, and the max fuel the A340-300 can carry is 148t?!

This is obviously a very basic calculation and I have no understanding of either travel carbon emissions or science really, but I just don't get what I'm missing in my understanding and how the weight of CO2 emissions seems to double compared to the fuel used?",explainlikeimfive,Eli5: how am I producing more than double the tons of carbon emissions than the technical weight of the fuel burned during a flight?

I know from experience, because I once took a bladder pain medication that turned my pee neon orange, that when I pee it splashes literally everywhere. And if you've ever been in a public bathroom, you know that sometimes people have explosive poop. Now wouldn't that get on the novel of the bidet?

You also have the ones that are completely separate unit from the toilet. So what do I do there waddle myself over to the bidet with pee dripping from my vag and poop between my butt cheeks? Also I've heard, I may be wrong that you are supposed to straddle up a bidet and face the back, so if that's true do I have to take off my pants? Seems like quite a process to just use the bathroom.

And this is my most wondered about question. Sometimes I get these really sticky poops, and I can tell you for a fact that a jet of water unless incredibly high volume and high speed to the point where it will probably hurt, is not getting that poop off my butt.

Tanwena,1628426102,p0dv6l,"Hi there,

I am having a discussion with a friend and we reached a stall as we disagree on some points and neither of us have the technical knowledge to prove their point.

The main question we have is: why is it that with modern cryptography and cybersecurity tech, no car manufacturer has yet implemented a way to prevent people from starting a car without some original (and irreplaceable) key (virtual or physical) connected to the owner? 

My friend's theory is that it would be possible to place the engine under the control of some sophisticated processor that stops it from being activated in absence of the right ""credentials"". Note: we are both aware of the fact that modern wireless car keys can be easily hijacked by capturing the signal as their design is currently flawed, we are talking about a case where the key's signature can't be cloned.

My theory is that if a thief gains physical access to the engine, it's relatively easy to physically hijack it and start the car even if the car's system is protected by some sophisticated cryptography - hence, there is no convenience for car's manufacturers to try to prevent car thefts in such a way.

Let’s assume a prototypical, consistent cycle in a healthy woman last 28 days.

Said woman, let’s call her Jane Doe, is best advised to have sex around 2 days before her ovulation, which is about 12-14 days after the first day of her period. 

Okay, Jane releases an egg that is fertilised 14 days into her cycle. So, on day 28, she should be 2 weeks pregnant, right? 

Well, not according to due date calculation based on the first day of your last period. In this case, your due date is calculated as ~280 days from the first day of your last period, which technically makes Jane 4 weeks pregnant on day 28 of her cycle, and 2 weeks pregnant at 14 days into her cycle.

Sunny Side Up eggs are difficult cause you gotta maintain the runny yolk, but not overcook it or undercook the white. 

In my head, this poses a logistical issue. 

When you’re serving hundreds of eggs, you must also keep them warm (I assume they are not all cooked to order). And keeping them warm (or under the little dome which preserves heat) will continue cooking the egg and by the time it gets to you, the yolk has set.

I’ve seen diagrams like the animation [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio#Radio_communication), but the more I think about it the less it makes sense to me. The AM one seems like it would work to transmit any music or other sound, because you can vary the volume to match the signal of the music, and change the amplitude in such a way as to match the pitch of the music, and all this at the frequency of the carrier signal. It’s easy to see how both the carrier frequency and signal frequency combine to make the broadcasted signal.

However, the FM one doesn’t seem like it would work. With no change in amplitude, you’re left with only frequency to transmit both the frequency and amplitude of the signal, while still somehow also maintaining the carrier frequency underneath. How is this possible? Is there a better illustration that shows how a signal with varying frequency and volume could be transmitted with FM? It’s further complicated by the fact that the carrier frequency is orders of magnitude higher than that of the sound you’re trying to transmit.

Because even if all parts receive an equal number of strokes or the cutting powder is equally spread between them, it won't work. So what causes the curvature? 

Maybe I should first ask how grinding works when they are both made of the same material. If one was harder than the other it would just cut away from the softer material.

Cosmic_Quasar,1627511701,otkrg1,"So I've used these password things for a few MMO's I've played. SWTOR and FFXIV. For the former I had a physical device where I'd push a button to get a number code, and for the latter I have an app on my phone that gives me a code. I can *maybe* see the phone one being different since the phone has internet so it could inform the game account what code is being displayed, but the physical device really confused me.

It's not connected to any sort of network. When I set it up I put in a serial number that was on the device to ""link"" it to my game account. But if the number is randomly generated how does my game know what code it generated? I thought maybe it was a sequence thing, like Code A has been used, so now it'll ask for Code B next time, then Code C... but I know this isn't the case as I've accidentally hit the physical button to display a code without then entering it into the game. It just always seems to work.

So then I thought maybe each serial number is linked to specific codes and all the codes associated with that device were acceptable. But over years of playing I can't recall ever starting to recognize codes. And if there were a large number of codes associated with each device that would make it easier for hackers to get into the game, right?

Supposedly, the Swift Tuttle comet orbits the sun every 133 years. But the Perseids meteor shower happens every Augustish. With a path so long (or maybe it's just slow) wouldn't the comet eventually get so far away from us that we won't see it for a long time? How do we cross paths with it yearly if it takes that long to orbit the sun?

Does this mean the Perseids shower is ""temporary"" or ""seasonal"" (as in, it'll be yearly for a few years while it's close before it gets too far) or is that not how it works? Because if it's truly truly annual, then I'm confused. The paths and maths in my head just don't seem to line up. Can someone please explain?

A number of them are made up, and a number of them are ""true"". 

I'm a big fan of its wholesomeness, safeness, and the campy, b movie style of a lot of stories. 

All the stories involved supernatural, paranormal, religious, or serendipitous occurrences which defy reality. 

At the end of each episode the host would go through and reveal which was fake and which was real. 

But all of the stories were all always equally farfetched, yet some stories are called ""true, according to first hand interviews"", or ""this really happened, in the late 80s in new York"", or ""a similar event occurred in 1995"". 

They never give any specifics of what parts of the story were true or how different the real event was from the reenactment, so no one can ever actually call bs. I get this, it's entertainment. 

But my question is, what qualifications if any did the show use in judging a story as ""true""? 

If we assume that the show's producers know we know it's all bs and made up, did they even have a threshold for truth, or was the whole truth lie thing always just a gimmick? 

Did these real life events that inspired the true segments ever actually occur?

theres so much to it that i can be here all day, but the point of all this is, i cant differentiate between bacteria, and i dont really know how they work either. in my head, if i go out in outside, and lets say i grab something that has cor\*na on it (like a handle on a bus or maybe a product in a store someone else has already touched), then reach for my phone, touching both myu pants and phone, and when i  later come home, go into the bathroom and wash my hand, isn't there still cor\*na on all the door handles? on my phone? my clothes?

obviously i know i am incorrect about some of that, but i simply dont know anything else, so i cant help but get nervous when i go anywhere in public, and i cant help but feel like washing my hands is pointless.

but on top of that, i already had some other personal problems which made it hard to sleep, but one day when i just changed bedsheets and and showered, that night was the first night in a very long time that i truly felt relaxed and calm, and that day started it all, and it just got worse and worse and worse, and i realized thinking about the potential bacteria i have all over me made me feel uncomfortable, stopping me from sleeping

so nowadays, i live a very destructive lifestyle, and i can't keep it up forever, and what ive learnt is that there are some bacteria thats important to have on your body, which doesn't make sense to me, but i knew already that there are bacteria in your stomach that break down food or whatever, i understood that's a thing, but recently i heard again that there are bacteria that are important to have on your body from a different person, so i understand that clearly thats a thing, doesn't mean i understand the difference, but i understand that its how it is.

so, the question i so desperately need answered are:

gljivana,1626970146,opgzhb,"Ok, this is going to sound stupid but I need some help.

I am 25.

I found that adding numbers is fairly hard for me. I can do super easy math like 10+10, 12+12 and similar. When there are less ""similar"" numbers, some of them I know by heart, like 7+8=15, but if I don't know it by heart I struggle a bit.

If there are bigger numbers, I already have lots trouble calculating it. For example 52+63=115, or 77+79. 

If there is something like this: 51+53+69 I have a hard time and it takes me a long time, much longer than other people I encounter. 
Subtraction is even more challenging to me.

I work as a waitress and this is giving me a really hard time. I have to keep reminding myself of each table how much they have to pay because it takes me an embarrassing amount of time to calculate it on the spot.
I am also a soon to be preschool teacher. _facepalms self_

Do you have an explanation for this? Do you have any tips to make this easier for me? My boyfriend tried to explain to me (first calculate tens, than the rest, try to visualize the numbers one below the other and do it like on paper etc), but I use these techniques already and the problem is that I struggle even with smallest numbers, it takes a lot of time and I can't seem to grasp it all at once.

Hi everyone,

Recently, i was studying the electronic distribution of atoms and it was all going fine until it got to the part about spin. My textbook presented spin as if it was just a fat with no causes or consequences, which is weird, since my physics teacher always tells us to try to contextualize as much as possible. So i decided to do some research into why electrons spin, and what they do.

  I've spent pretty much the whole day trying to understand what causes the electron to spin, and what arises from it, but I still couldn't find a satisfactory answer. At first, I read that the spin of electrons create the magnetic field of an atom, but then another page told me that it has little do with it. Then, there's a whole thing that they don't actually spin at all, which confused me even further. 

To be frank I'm completely lost in the matter, and I would appreciate any direction as to Why and How the electron spins, and if the spin is what creates the magnetic field or not. 

Thanks,

&gt;In general, modern scientific deep-sea exploration can be said to have begun when French scientist Pierre Simon de Laplace investigated the average depth of the Atlantic ocean by observing tidal motions registered on Brazilian and African coasts. He calculated the depth to be 3,962 metres (12,999 ft), a value later proven quite accurate by echo-sounding measurement techniques.


How did my man Laplace, who has humbled me in so many calc classes, figure this out? What was his intuition? I tried following the citation link but it was fruitless. I have found this page on the [Theory of tides](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_tides&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPsPf_0PHxAhVHHc0KHXfqChcQFjADegQILxAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw1FE4wpjDLESuu5VFMXe9LH) as well as this link to a paper of [""A derivation of Laplace’s tidal equation from the theory of inertial oscillations""](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1975.0090%23:~:text%3DLaplace%27s%2520tidal%2520equation%2520is%2520derived,acceleration%2520is%2520not%2520neglected%2520explicitly.&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPsPf_0PHxAhVHHc0KHXfqChcQFjABegQIFRAF&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ZwC3ucBeL99WpuyijnY4r).

Ash_username,1626734606,onp5lv,"If cell turnover is increased, I’d assume these types of products encourage cell apoptosis. I’d assume this is why I’ve read that, clinically, it may be able to ‘fight cancer’. 

But if cell turnover is increased, doesn’t this mean there’s more chances for a cell to exist which is cancerous? 

E.g. (albeit a poor example)

Normal cell turnover = 3 cells live and die per unit (“x”) amount of time. Meaning that per “x” unit of time, 3 cells existed. 

Retinol turnover = 3 cells live per x/2 amount of time, meaning that per “x” unit of time, 6 cells existed. 

So this is 6 chances for a cancerous cell to exist, rather than the original 3, for the same (given) amount of time?

What I've noticed is that there is a TON of variance in how people choose to live their lives. My grandpa tells me to not get married and says it comes from a place of wisdom. My grandma says the opposite but it still comes from a place of wisdom.

To me, it makes zero sense. If life is incredibly personal, and there is a lot of variance in what is considered ideal, why would you listen to someone else's ""wisdom"" for living life? It would be one thing if all old people agreed on something. But they don't.

What is preventing workers from big corporations or any business for that matter from filing class action lawsuits against the companies they work for inadequate pay if their share of the payout of the profit is small or a fraction in comparison to the net profit being generated... Shouldn't we have a system that requires a certain level of profits from a profitable company be dedicated to the workers who helped build the business and keep the business running.... so that profits aren't disproportionally paid to the CEO or partners or board members of said corporation while workers wages are stagnated? Even in the circumstances of equity in the company... Shouldn't anyone who is part of the company earn stock if they are hired and be a part owner that is proportional to their contribution... I believe in capitalism but the way that the current system is set up it disproportionally favors the business starters over it's workers... The working class creates and maintains the wealth of the company as much as the person who starts it... I believe that if you start a business that you are entitled to a greater share if the profits but is there any legal ground that workers can explore to secure their right to just compensation if they are being underpaid? We all know that trying to get congress to write laws is impossible and that the majority of ppl we elect just keep the status quo.

The only thing I could think of is that the pressure inside their bodies maybe equalize the pressure on the outside.

Which brings me the to the last part of the question. As a part of that video, I saw that a leatherback sea turtle has a maximum diving depth of 1,280 meters. Yet just before that it mentioned that the pressure that far down is roughly equivalent to a polar bear standing on a postage stamp. I can kind of overlook how fish do it, but I can't really imagine a polar bear standing on a sea turtle's face and it be just fine.

According to special(?) relativity, nothing that carries information can travel faster than the speed of light. This seems to include changes in any force fields. I saw an animation a while back that shows what would happen if the sun instantaneously disappeared: the previously curved spacetime would “straighten out” at the speed of light in a “wave” emanating from the sun's position. Planets far away from the sun at the time of disappearing would continue to feel the sun's gravity for a short time because their region of spacetime would still be curved (until the “wave” hits them).

My question is how does this work for the electric and magnetic fields? Suppose my aforementioned giant electromagnet starts in the “on” state and some planet a few light-seconds away can feel the magnetic field. If I switch the electromagnet off, that planet is still going to feel a magnetic field for a few seconds until the field changes propagate outward.

missmodera,1626228505,ojuiuv,"Just to preface, I'm not autistic and I don't have any learning difficulties. However, this is something I feel like I'm supposed to naturally understand, but so far I don't.

I tend to raise my voice when I'm angry or aggravated. I understand this is inappropriate in a lot of situations and I'm trying to work on it.  I understand that it upsets people. I understand that it's considered a bad thing, but I simply don't understand why.

I don't understand why shouting is considered *inherently* bad. Like, in almost every situation it is frowned upon. For example, my sister dismisses anything I say when I yell or raise my voice in an argument, even if it's important. She says it's childish and immature to shout. She says that shouting is only something children do, and we're adults now. I've been lying in bed thinking about it, and I've realised that I genuinely don't understand it.

I feel like shouting is a natural physical reaction to anger. Just like laughing is to joy, and crying is to sadness. Of course you shouldn't laugh or cry in all situations, but they aren't seen as inherently bad the way shouting is.

It seems like adults are only excused from yelling when they have been gravely and extremely wronged, but that makes no sense to me. It's considered okay to cry if you've experienced something as simple as a bad day. So why is it only socially acceptable to shout in extreme cases? Sure, it's not enjoyable to be shouted at, but shouting isn't the only uncomfortable emotional reaction to be around. And this may be subjective, but I think being shouted at for a few seconds by someone who is rightfully angry at you isn't a big deal.

Idk. Being told I'm not supposed to raise my voice just feels like I'm being told to not express emotion.",explainlikeimfive,Eli5: Why is shouting considered almost inherently bad? (Sociology/ Physchology/ Common knowledge)

Banach and Tarski proved that, using isometric transformations, the result of taking apart and reassembling a two-dimensional figure would necessarily have the same area as the original. This would make creating two unit squares out of one impossible. But in a 1929 paper, **von Neumann proved that paradoxical decompositions could use a group of transformations that include as a subgroup a free group with two generators. The group of area-preserving transformations contains such subgroups, and this opens the possibility of performing paradoxical decompositions using these subgroups.** The class of groups von Neumann isolated in his work on Banach–Tarski decompositions was very important in many areas of mathematics, including von Neumann's own later work in measure theory.",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Von Neumann paradox

In case they purposefully do something that doesn't provide growth (e.g. increase salaries, when in fact, they could get away with lower salaries), shareholders can sue them.

You might say that shoudn't offer IPO in the first place to avoid that. Even if that's the case, the current system incentivizes this behavior. If we have two companies that provide near identical products/services, the one that cuts corners will always win. In other words, good people go, incentives always stay.

* Player conflict is indirect, with little or no combat.
* No player elimination.
* Minimal randomness i.e. dice are rare.
* Emphasis on the game designer i.e. their name on the front cover
* Attention to artwork, pieces, and theming. 
* Deep strategy, with minimal game mechanics but multiple paths to victory.

The problem with this kind of definition is that so many strategy games would seem to fit this mold despite never being marketed as or considered Euros, especially with the disclaimer that not all Euro games need to meet all the points of the definition. *Civilization* would seem to fit, but I've never heard it called a Euro game:

* While war is a game mechanic, the latest Civ games are not *wargames per se* with a huge variety of win conditions. The other ways to win involve indirect competition like building wonders first, spreading your religion, or gaining cultural influence.
* Players get eliminated in Civ, but this doesn't always happen and isn't strictly necessary for non-Domination victories.
* Randomness in starting position and combat. This is the biggest point against it being a Euro by BGG's definition, but the other points seem okay.
* It's *Sid Meier's Civilization*, so emphasis on the designer certainly fits.
* Maybe this is somewhat N/A or redundant since video games by definition always have some emphasis on graphics, but Civ has tons of detailed models of units, terrain, and cities. It also really does love its theming with you meeting historical leaders, civ-unique units, wonder buildings, and so on.

If there are multiple offers at the $275k price point that's pretty good evidence that the demand is high, supply is low and the value, at least to those making the offers, is $275k because that's what they are willing to pay. It just doesn't make sense to me that anyone could come in and say the value is anything other than what someone is willing to pay. Isn't that how capitalism is supposed to work?

All the explanations I've read so far talk about how the algebraic expression of the roots have to belong to the same field (Galois field) to be solvable, but how is that actually determined and why does it prove anything about solvability, especially since most of what they express is (theoretically) already covered by the algebraic expressions themselves?

For example, the image on the Wikipedia page for Galois theory (can't copy the link fsr) shows sqrt(2), sqrt(6), and sqrt(3) so my guess is that because the operation of roots is division, the Galois field and Q need the containing the dividend over one of those roots that gives the other root as a quotient to adjoin Q and Gal - but I'm guessing that's wildly off-base given how complex a subject it's supposed to be.",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: what do Galois groups actually prove about solvability?

papahet1,1625104946,obbtjt,"I suppose it could vary from city to city, state to state, country to country, but I’ve always wondered how they determine the address numbers.  I would assume it would need to be a certain distance.  Suppose they’re building a new subdivision, and the existing house on the corner is 120 Arthur Street.  If they start building the first house 1000 yards down the street, they have to have some logical way to come up with 165 Arthur Street as the address for that new house, right?

In cities with the grid system, I know that streets in downtown areas are often labeled 100 South, 200 South, 300 South, etc. and the distance between those streets is often called a “block.”  But is a “block” even a standard distance?  What is a “block,” really?  Is it a standard measurement, or is it just an arbitrary distance between two addresses?  If I have to travel from 200 South to 900 South, I would say that is 7 blocks.  But if I get into the suburbs and travel from 9000 South to 9700 South, is that “7 blocks” the same actual distance as the 7 blocks downtown?

It seems like there would need to be some logical way of measuring/labeling addresses, but what is it?  It seems like I should be able to calculate the exact distance between two given addresses (or at least get pretty close, since “2100 South” might actually be located at 2101 South), but how?

All attempts at Google have been for naught.  Hopefully there’s a city planner or someone smarter than me here today.  Thanks for all your help!

I've heard of people installing Crysis into VRAM but that's through setting space aside as a virtual drive.

Of course, at the time games were made to play around having less RAM, for users on lower-end systems or consoles, so are they just built in ways where they don't 'take more than they need'? For modern, smaller indie games that could already fit in the RAM of most machines, is it just because having everything loaded would possibly cause engine issues? Is that why?

Heller_Demon,1624602469,o7i1r9,"[Although structures in the Universe form on a wide variety of scales, from small dwarf galaxies to large super clusters, the generation of angular momentum across these scales is poorly understood. Here we investigate the possibility that filaments of galaxies—cylindrical tendrils of matter hundreds of millions of light years across—are themselves spinning. By stacking thousands of filaments together and examining the velocity of galaxies perpendicular to the filament’s axis (via their redshift and blueshift), we find that these objects too display vortical motion consistent with rotation, making them the largest objects known to have angular momentum. The strength of the rotation signal is directly dependent on the viewing angle and the dynamical state of the filament. Filament rotation is more clearly detected when viewed edge-on. In addition, the more massive the haloes that sit at either end of the filaments, the more rotation is detected. These results signify that angular momentum can be generated on unexpectedly large scales.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01380-6)

**Question:**

My question is around a 'cure'. If this is the case, is it not possible to replicate non-fatal damage in the area the cells are being produced to act as a decoy for them to focus on/repair? Or would the cells continue to multiply beyond the amount required to repair said damage?

Second part I am curious about is the effects of long term smokers or long term users of other cancer causing products suddenly quitting late in life. Are they more likely to develop cancer as their body no longer has to repair the cells it  has overproduced to mitigate damage from these products their entire life?

However, if being recorded is what causes the wave to collapse into a particle, why do they only collapse when we try detect how many particles came through one of the slits? There’s a screen marking where each particle lands. How is the recording of where the particles land on that screen not causing the waves to collapse into particles? It seems like that’s as much of a recording as an atom bouncing off of whatever is being shot into the double stilts. 

Also wouldn’t this experiment have to take place in zero gravity for the path of the particle to be informationally isolated?

Feisty-Inflation5,1623856340,o1764j,"I understand ""stable"" glitches. By stable, I mean glitches that occur whenever you put in an unexpected input. For instance, a programmer may not have expected users to enter ""0"" into a field. So **every time** I enter 0, the program glitches. Or **every time** XYZ situation happens, a glitch occurs.

But I don't understand unstable glitches. That is, glitches that appear to happen randomly even if you perfectly replicate the scenario. Why do these happen?

I wrote a simple autohotkey script for example:

    &gt;+Up::{Volume_Up}

It seems like 90% of the time it works, and 10% of the time it doesn't. As a test, I used the function in as controlled of an environment as I could do. I am not opening new programs or doing anything new. I disconnected from the internet, closed all backgroun processes, etc. The only thing that changes is the time. I just sit on my Desktop changing the volume, and sometimes it randomly doesn't work. That wouldn't be due to inconsistency between the layers, since nothing is changing except me pushing the volume up button.

To clarify, I am not looking for help troubleshooting my script. I am just curious about the general reasons for unstable glitches. I mean, code is a logical flow of instructions, so if you replicate the glitch inputs, the glitch should occur again. But some glitches occur once and can never be replicated.

&amp;#x200B;

\- What exactly \*is\* the blockchain? I know mining rigs need beefy GPUs to do the mining, but \*what\* are they mining from? Is the block chain a file, a server, a whole server farm?

\- Piggy backing off that, what is it that is happening when crypto is mined? I've read that the mining PC is basically just solving huge amounts of math. Why are high end video cards needed for that? I'd imagine that'd be more CPU heavy.

&amp;#x200B;

\- When crypto is mined, where is a person's collected crypto stored? On their PC, (huge red flag there, so I imagine not), a server somewhere? How is the existence of each cryptocoin tracked? 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Adding to that, I've read that the benefit of using crypto is that it's not centralized, government can't see who owns how much or where it's going. How does this not leave huge opportunities for fraud? There must be \*some\* centralization to keep track of all of the crypto, and even then with it being anonymous, it's still doesn't seem that air tight.",explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Cryptocurrency, more specifically the technical side of blockchains"

* I'm starting with the equation that Lift is proportional to Angle of Attack times the Airspeed. Meaning that if one goes down, the other has to go up to maintain lift.

* My assumption is that the equation above assumes regular airflow over the wing. Therefore, stalling happens when you hit a certain Angle of Attack because the air ceases to stick to the top of the wing. That angle is labeled as the Critical Angle of Attack. We can't increase airspeed to compensate because this would not restore regular airflow. This is an upper limit of sorts.

* So my understanding is that stall speed (Vs) is the minimum speed that you can fly to maintain lift = weight? For any given Airspeed, can we reduce the Angle of Attack to prevent stalling?

* If apparent weight on the aircraft increases (e.g. while turning), why does stall speed increase? Is it because the previous the previous stall speed is no longer sufficient to maintain lift?",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: The relationship between stall speed and angle of attack?

Oftentimes you'll hear people talking about the idealistic approach to a scenario being better or worse than the pragmatic one, but if pragmatic means being sensible, realistic, and practical, wouldn't the pragmatic method be the one that gives you the best chance of reaching one or more desired outcomes, and therefore objectively be the best method?

For a scenario where only one outcome is important (very rare in the real world), the pragmatic method would obviously be the one with the highest probability of achieving that result.

For a scenario where multiple outcomes are desired, it gets more complicated. If x and y are both desired outcomes, with outcome x being more valuable than y, the pragmatic approach then would be the one that gives the best chance of overall positivity to result, based on the individual probabilities x and y have of occurring, and based on how much more valuable x is than y. Same goes for situations with 3+ desired outcomes.

The Hubble volume is a region in space containing everything we can physically interact with. Objects outside of our Hubble volume are receding away from us faster than the speed of light and are therefore impossible to interact with for us.

Now consider an object A at the very edge of our Hubble Volume. It is receding away from us near the speed of light. Near object A is object B. Object B is at a greater distance from us than A, such that B lies outside of our Hubble volume. According to my understanding of the Hubble volume, we can never interact with Object B under any circumstances.

However, imagine the following complication of this setup: Object B is a spaceship, and it maintains an equal distance to Object A at all times by firing its thrusters very rarely to make up for the distance increased between it and Object A due to the expansion of space.

Now, Object A is inside our Hubble volume. Object B is outside of it, but at a constant distance from Object A.

We now travel to Object A. By the time we reach Object A, where is Object B? Can we reach it? Similarly, could the captain of Object B launch a dropship in advance to Object A to meet us when we arrive?",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Can things enter our Hubble volume?

Basically I read on the good old internet that if you stare for a period of time into the mirror that your brain will start playing tricks on you and scare you.

A few times I thought I've seen someone behind me for a split second, or that my face moves even tho I didn't move a muscle etc. Why would our brain do that to ourselves since it could harm us by making us panic therefore it being bad for our brain? Is there any reason that our brain does that? I'm quiet certain it's not to protect us is it?


Additionally does this maybe explain why people say they seen bloody marry or other ghost storys connected to mirrors? That our brain for some reason plays tricks on us? Since if we go into the bathroom and we expect to see bloody marry by doing that ritual that our brain tricks us and makes us see it just cause we expected it to be there?
