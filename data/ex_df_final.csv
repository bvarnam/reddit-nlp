j_d0tnet,1631248750,ple5nz,"Disclaimer: I did see a previous question touching on something like this but what I'm confused about was NOT addressed so hopefully this is allowed.

They say that the surface area volume ratio limits how big things can grow because surface area scales as a square while volume scales as a cube, so the ratio of volume to surface area goes up as you get bigger. Fair enough. BUT: how is this not just a matter of what units you're using?

For example, a 1x1x1 ft cube has a surface area to volume ratio of 6sq. Ft to 1 cubic foot, so 6:1. A 1x1x1 meter cube has a ratio of 6:1 too but the units are meters. Couldn't you always define your units so that you have a 6:1 ratio with any size of cube?

To bring it back to the actual question, wouldn't your ratio be essentially the same no matter how big your object is? Imagine you expanded everything in the universe by the same amount but kept your unit of measurement the same, you wouldn't suddenly hit some limit where it stops working right? Does it have something to do with the size of molecules and proteins etc? Please help I am so confused",explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: Seriously, WTF is up with surface area and volume limiting how big things can grow??","'hc9xp88', 'hc9xubv', 'hc9y66a', 'hc9ybwi', 'hc9yhf0', 'hc9zmnm', 'hca0wl5', 'hca3egc', 'hcab72n', 'hcahr92', 'hcat6ax', 'hcb072v', 'hcb1nm8'",13,"The surface area to volume ratio is unit-independent, yes. But that doesn’t change the physical meaning of the ratio.

Say that for each cubic foot of living matter, you need 1 pound/min of oxygen. Each square foot can provide 0.3 pounds/min through it. For your 1ft cubic organism, you can provide 6x0.3=1.8 pound/min of oxygen, which is more than the 1 pound/min needed. Good.

Let’s go to the bigger cube. 1 meter = 3.3 ft. 1 cubic meter is 3.3^3 ~ 36 cubic ft, so 36 pound/min of oxygen needed. The surface can provide 6x(3.3x3.3)x0.3 = 19.6 pound/min of oxygen. Not good.

Just playing with units doesn’t change the inherent fact that volume is what determines cellular needs/uptake, while surface area determines nutrient/gas/excretion availability/rate. Since volume scales up faster than surface area, so too does cellular demand scale up faster than nutrient/gas availability."

Chardington,1631244279,pld1sd,"I’ve been getting into finance, stonks and crypto lately and I love researching and learning. But one word I’ve never fully understood is “liquidity”.

Does it mean a bunch of stocks?
Is it a noun, an adjective?
What does it mean to provide liquidity?
What does it mean to liquidate?
What does it mean to be solvent/insolvent?

Cash is obviously the most liquid since you can transfer and spend funds in a bank account immediately. 

Stocks are considered good liquidity because you can sell stocks and have the cash in your account in 3 days. 

What about your house? It isn’t very liquid since you have to put it on the market snd that can take a while. So if you need money quickly, this won’t help you…assuming you want full value of it and not giving it at a discount. 

Liquidate is to completely turn an asset into cash. 
You own 10 shares of a company? You sell 10 shares? You’ve liquidated. Sell a car? You liquidated your car. 

You sell the house? Liquidated that asset as you no longer have it, and instead have cash.

Also, how liquid something is relative to how quickly you need the cash. Let’s say you own a Rolex worth 15k. You could try and sell it for 15k but that will take some time. If you’re in a hurry you could sell it for 100 dollars and someone will buy it instantly. Selling the house for a million? Takes time. Sell for 100,000..quick but not full market value."

When you take any number and divide it by 1/3, let’s say you’re dividing 5 (instead of 8 over 3, it works the same, 5 is just a simpler example.)

So you have 5 divided by 1/3.

This is like taking 5 apples, and dividing them into groups where each group only has 1/3rd of an apple.

Which is like cutting an apple into thirds. 

Which is like taking 1 Apple and making it 3 pieces. One piece for each group.

So for each apple, you get 3 pieces, so if you divide all 5 apples, you get 15 pieces. 5 divided by 1/3 is 15.

Just like multiplying 5 by 3.

Multiplication and division are just opposite functions.

For example, you could do this in reverse. Say you want to take 10, and divide it by 2.  That gives you 5. Or you could take 10, and multiply it by 1/2 (or 0.5). Which also gives you 5."

Which is great when you're not so concerned about over torquing the screw since you're usually sinking robertsons into framing lumber and drywall and deck planks; the screw head is usually flush with the surface of the wood before you think about letting up on it and unless you hit something beyond what you're sinking it into, you can't really over torque it, it just sinks a but further into the wood.

Meanwhile, the Phillips or cross head is designed so that if you put too much torque on it, the head of your screwdriver will tend to ""cam out"" or lever itself out of the slot on the screw head, therefore not damaging your screw or your driver (this was ~1900s before torque limiting screw drivers were a thing). 

Lastly, the hex heads or Allen screws will tend to also cam-out if you apply too much torque, but since you have six transfer surfaces instead of 4 you get better torque transfer which is ideal if you're screwing on an angle with a rounded ball head driver, particularly if the screw head is really tiny. To provide the same contact surface for a Philips head screw your head would have to be much larger which might blow your allotment for a flush head in a chamfer or a small hole.

Coming back to your regular slot head screw, well... they're cheapest / easiest to make. So each type of screw has its advantages and disadvantages.

EMP weapons aren't really a thing yet - at least not like in the movies.

The general idea is that powerful radio waves can induce high voltages in electronics, at least shutting them off and at most completely permanently disabling them.

If these radio waves have a specific frequency, they tend not to work as well, and so you want a rather noisy electrical signal. This happens naturally if the signal is produced in a short pulse. On top of that, a short pulse can be stronger if it is shorter, since a sustained 'pulse' will keep drawing power until switched off and that energy will be spread out over time.

I don't know if any viable EMP weapons currently exist, but the largest recorded manmade EMP event was from a nuclear blast in the upper atmosphere, which interacted with the atmosphere to produce a powerful and wide-reaching EMP which damaged electronics across the pacific. Called *Starfish Prime* if you're curious.

My personal favorite is the EPFCG, which uses an actual explosive to generate a sudden surge of electrical energy, which is then presumably sent to an antenna. AFAIK no successful designs of this are available to the public."

It has a main super-powerful magnet which is always on, and then it has some electromagnets which are normally kept switched off, but can be electronically controlled (rapidly switched on and off, weakened and strengthened and reversed) to actually run the scan.

When you have 2 magnets close to each other, they can repel or they can attract. So, during the scan, when the controllable electromagnets are switched on or off, they suddenly get attracted or repelled from the main magnet. This causes them to move slightly and make a noise.

This is the same way that a loudspeaker works. You have a permanent magnet, and a controllable electromagnet connected to a cone. The electromagnet is controlled with an electrical wave, and it repels or attracts the main magnet, causing it to move pushing the cone around to produce sound. 

Because the magnets in an MRI are so powerful (even the switchable electromagnets are extremely powerful), they attract so strongly that, even though they are bolted down and reinforced, they still move around and bend from the attraction/repulsion forces. They can be pushed around with many tonnes of force. This is why the machines are so loud.

By way of comparison to loudspeakers, an MRI scanner controls its electromagnets with a set of amplifiers, which are very similar to hi-fi amplifiers. The only difference  is that the MRI amplifiers are the size of a large refrigerator and have a power output measured in 100,000s of Watts. The last MRI scanner which I just had installed came with a 250,000 Watt amplifier (peak power 3,000,000 Watts!). The power company had to come out an install a new power line for that one."

We separate them faaar far apart and then observe one, if we find out that one is spinning left at that point, we for sure know the other one is spinning right. We just got information from a distance far apart faster then light-speed. Thus creating a paradox. If this understanding is wrong please correct me and if correct please tell me why:

Fitting a neural network is, basically, choosing values for a large set of parameters for the model. This is, functionally no different from how simple linear models are fit. I think there is a relationship between X and Y of the form Y = mX + b. I'm just trying to solve for m and b to make mX+b as close to Y as possible.

Imagine a graph with three axes. the X-axis denotes values we could choose for m and the Y-axis denotes values we could choose for B. The z-axis measures how incorrect a the model is (that is, the difference between mX+B and Y). We want to find the lowest point on the Z-axis, where the model is least wrong. The function into which we plug in our parameters (m and b in this case) and see how wrong we are is called our loss function.

Let's start by picking a random point (i.e., pick a random m and b and see how wrong we are). If we can take a derivative of our loss function with respect to m and b we can see which direction we should move each of those parameters to decrease the loss. As such, we tweak the parameters in those directions and try again. We keep doing this until the derivative with respect to all the parameters is at (or very close to) 0, indicating we've arrived at a minimum of loss.

I've glossed over a lot of detail and this isn't all encompassing, but again, it boils down to:

* fitting your model is all about picking values for a set of parameters that define the model

* If you have a function that can measure your loss based on choices for those parameters, and that function is differentiable with respect to your parameters, you can see which direction you need to tweak your parameters to move toward a minimum loss"

P.s. if you want more detail, it comes down to this: unlike hormones, neurotransmitters do not have specific functions. People often describe e.g. dopamine as ""the reward chemical"", but A: dopamine is also involved in controlling lactation, why are you not calling it ""the lactation chemical"", dopamine is also involved in movement control so why aren't you calling it the movement chemical, etc. etc. etc., and B: for all of those functions, a bunch of other neurotransmitters are ALSO involved, so why aren't you calling THEM reward / lactation / movement chemicals, etc. etc...

There is NOTHING that especially relates dopamine to reward. Ditto all the rest (serotonin and mood, and so on)."

Most classic game cartridges on systems like the NES didn't have any sort of save feature at all, while others used password systems to continue where a player left off specifically because it didn't require saving any data.

Those games that did save data did so using a small amount of NVRAM built into the cartridge. NVRAM needs a power supply to maintain its data, so these cartridges were equipped with a watch battery to supply power when the power on the console was turned off.

Most games didn't do this because adding NVRAM increased the cost, so it was reserved for games where it made the most sense like complex RPG games like Final Fantasy or the Legend of Zelda that you couldn't reasonably finish in one sitting.

As for why the cartridges were the same size, that's not entirely true. The exterior shell was the same but if you open the cartridge shell you'll see that the actual circuit boards were only about 1/3 the size of the overall cartridge. Most games with a save module had slightly larger boards, so they were in fact larger.

So why didn't games save state on the NES itself like most systems do today?

Storage media has come a long way in 35 years. Today Hard Drives are ubiquitous and adding a medium sized hard drive to a gaming console only increases the overall cost by around $40-75 (since the console developers pay wholesale price for the drives) while in the 80s Hard Drives had relatively tiny capacities, were quite large and bulky, and very expensive. Having a computer in your home was far from common place and many like the Apple iie and Commodore 64 didn't even come shipped with hard drives.

In the days of the NES even a common floppy drive was a considerable piece of hardware and would have significantly increased the cost of the NES. Which is why the NES disk drive (Japan Only) was an expensive peripheral.

Compact Flash didn't exist so you're only options were magnetic storage (cassette tape of floppies), EPROMs which were chips that would easily break, or NVRAM which was particularly expensive.

Adding a large amount of NVRAM RAM to the NES or Sega would have been very costly and wasn't deemed to be necessary by the designers. Why put that cost into the console? when you can put much smaller amounts of NVRAM into the cartridges themselves for much less cost.

Also keep in mind that in that previous era systems like the Atari 2600, Intellivision and Coleco Vision didn't save games either so it wasn't seen as a necessary development at the time."

1. You borrow money to buy a house. You can't actually afford to repay this loan with your income, but the lender gives you a low interest rate that will increase later, or may even commit fraud to get the loan approved. It's called ""subprime"" lending because you wouldn't be able to get normal loans. The bank that issues the loan makes money from the fees and has an incentive to approve as many loans as it can.
2. A corporation run by the federal government will guarantee repayment of the loan, making it less risky for the bank and so more likely that this kind of loan can be approved. It doesn't really know about fraud or look your financial situation in detail.
2. Another bank buys the loan as an investment, because now it owns the right to receive your loan repayments with interest. Again, it's not looking too closely at what the loan really is.
3. Banks then package a lot of these loans together as an investment product they can sell to ordinary investors.
4. Rating agencies evaluate how likely this investment is to pay off--they say that home loans are really likely to be repaid and give most of these packages a AAA (very good) rating, even though the loans in this case are actually pretty risky.
5. Wall Street investment firms, pension funds, and all sorts of other investors buy these investments seeing that the rating agencies consider them pretty safe. None of them are looking at the individual loans that make up these funds.
6. Investors make deals that spread the risk of non-payment out to other firms, like taking out insurance, or they multiply the potential risk or reward, such as by borrowing money to make this investment.
7. The easy access to loans all this investment produces makes a lot more people buy houses, or borrow more money against the increased value of their house. Then companies start building a lot of new houses to meet that demand, and you also see growth in other areas like cars and car loans. The economy is booming and in large part it's due to all this borrowed money being spent on housing.

When people stop repaying those loans, it's like taking the bottom bricks out of a Jenga tower. These big funds that everybody thought  were good investments actually turn out to be very risky. The size of the investments is so huge that even the federal corporation and the private insurance companies that were supposed to protect against the risk of nonpayment are unable to do so because they can't pay that much. Everyone else that was expecting housing prices to go up and the economy to continue to grow also loses money. When so many people have lost money and companies are closing, you see big job losses. People that really were safe borrowers now are unable to make their payments too. Ultimately, any company that sells anything feels the result of there being less money to go around--even if they weren't directly connected to the housing market at all."

Rocket propulsion - RPG, missiles

Explosive propulsion - mortars, guns

Electromagnetic propulsion - railguns

The type tanks use in the main gun is generally explosive. So you have a few things necessary to make an explosion propelled projectile both accurate and deadly.
First is the weight of the projectile. The larger the shell, the more energy its going to be carrying.

Second is the size of the explosive charge. A bigger explosion means you can use heavier shells and also make them travel faster - which gives you more energy and more range and more piercing capabilities.

Third is the geometry of the barrel, it needs to be wide enough for the shell to travel along it. But narrow enough that the explosive force is directed only onto the shell instead of escaping around the edges.
A longer barrel generally makes the projectile more accurate. Some barrels have rifling which makes the projectile rotate to maintain directional stability.


So to answer you question about cannon dimensions
length - accuracy

width - caliber (momentum)


Some projectiles also carry a payload of explosives to detonate on or shortly after impact.

North American English diverged from British English over a century before Australian English diverged from British English. 

Therefore Americans and Canadians sound less British than Australians.

Which is purely abstract since there is no baseline and never was. In Britain, the accents are extremely pronounced from one region to the next.

Again, we talk the same way the people around us talk. 

The smaller the bubble, the more unique the accent. 

Big metropolitan cities have people with all sorts of accents converging on them, so they tend to blend together and neutralize one another. Those are big, diverse bubbles so there’s not really a pronounced accent.

On the flip side, a rural town deep in the American south isn’t likely going to have many outsiders visiting, so the bubble is much smaller, and the accent more up distinct.

AneesZafar,1630922852,piwknt,"Stephen Hawking in ""A Brief History of Time"" (Chapter 9) says that the no boundary condition of the universe explains the existence of intelligent life forms.

Time just ceases to exist as we know it. However, the no boundary condition is part of a description of the fundamental wave function or reality of the universe? As such either it produces a universe which is stable enough and has matter etc that can develop unintelligent life where a different version would not or it suggests the possibility of multiple universes of which some will be stable and complex enough for life to develop - I’m not entirely sure which or both. 

As far as entropy is concerned , in order for intelligent life to exist I think he proposes that there must be short term , localised ways of reversing entropy. Presumably the no boundary condition / wave function of reality is such that despite entropy the conditions are  such that localised reversals are possible within our universe?

So. Back to your first question.

The taste of food starts to go away for a combination of two reasons, first is that you’re swallowing/running out of the chemicals in the food for your taste buds to interact with.

Second is that while our brain likes taking all kinds of information in, it actually starts to filter out “extra” unimportant stuff.

Have you ever walked into a room and smelled food cooking, and then realized a couple minutes later you couldn’t really smell the food anymore.

Other businesses dislike unions because they don't like feeling like they're in absolute control of what happens at the workplace, and the workers have more power. 

Some people feel that unions can go too far, and dislike that part of being in a union is giving a portion of your paycheck to the union, generally going into a fund so that if people have to go on strike, there's money for them to survive off of while they strike and stop working.

1) current price of apple stock is 50 usd. buy call option for apple at strike price 50 usd. Do NOT buy an apple stock

The electromagnetic field inside the transformer exerts a force on the coils (this is how electric motors work). However, \*unlike\* a motor, the transformer doesn't have any mechanism to make the force go in a consistent direction...the force oscillates back and forth with the AC.

Good transformers will securely mount the coils so they don't move under that alternating force. Cheap ones don't...so you hear a buzz because they literally are vibrating the coils. The force is proportional to the current in the coils, so when they're not pulling any power they should be pretty quiet and it gets louder as the power goes up.

I don't know what's up with your WiFi plugs, but it's probably some component in their AC-to-DC converter. 

Wall transformers will consume a small amount of power while plugged in just because they're not perfect...some of the power ""leaks"" and doesn't go to the other side of the coil, which will show up as a little bit of EM radiation and heat."

To be this argument seems rather weak. Are there any other reason why we would be seeing a labor shortage?

Yes! Several, in fact.

Many school districts continue to use some form of distance learning or hybridized version, which means there are more kids at home during the day and thus more adults need to be home to supervise them.

During the last year, various economic measures were put in place to ease the financial hardships of the pandemic, such as suspending student loan interest and payments, and eviction moratoriums. Many people were able to take advantage of these measures to improve their personal finances. With fewer people living paycheck-to-paycheck, people have more freedom to decide where they work, and for what wages. 

The workforce itself is smaller. While COVID has been hardest on the elderly and disabled, there are still *millions* of people who were previously part of the workforce who died.

There's also a timing issue. In normal circumstances, lots of places are hiring a few people, all the time. But following shut-down orders and occupancy restrictions, you have a situation where **every** restaurant is trying to hire people *all at the same time*. It's the difference between a line of people walking through a door, and a crowd of people all trying to push through at once. 

Skilled labor positions are going unfilled because companies have, for a while now, refused to train employees. Specialized fields like IT are notorious for being unwilling to hire employees who don't have the precise skill-set they're looking for, and equally unwilling to train staff. Some portion of the millions of COVID dead were people in those skilled positions that can't quickly or easily be replaced without additional training. 

Also, there are literally hundreds of sources that show that wages haven't kept up with inflation, with productivity gains in the workplace, with rents and student loans and costs of living. Pre-pandemic, that meant people were accepting living in poverty, but with the threat of *literal death* on top of living in poverty, it's led a lot of people to look for alternatives. 

Finally, the jobs report came out today for the U.S., and it shows that even in states where the bonus unemployment payments were cut off, job growth is sluggish. The notion that extra money de-incentivized work is pretty solidly disproven by that data. The harder truth is that work has pretty solidly been de-incentivized by low wages, poor benefits, a lack of training, a lack of advancement opportunities, and generally bad working conditions."

Sometimes the baby needs a little help to get out and there are tools like forceps that the medical staff can use to help bring the baby along by essentially pulling along with the contractions, while the mother pushes.

There are also abnormal occasions, such as the baby being breached, which is when the baby is coming out feet first (should be head first as that is more streamlined) and the consultant or midwife will need to intervene to ensure safe delivery.

In extreme cases, especially where the mother and baby are at risk, the baby is delivered by C-section. This where an incision is made in the lower abdomen and the baby is pulled out through the hole created, rather than exiting via the vagina. It is also not uncommon for C-section to be elective (i.e. there is no immediate risk but C-section is used anyway)"

Adding additional valves can increase the total area of the valves so you can move the air/exhaust through faster/easier and generate more power.

Changing from 1 intake valve to 2 can also result in smaller valves which instead of being a hefty piece of metal with a strong spring to pull it back, you instead have to much smaller lighter pieces which you can move faster meaning the engine can reliably rev up much higher.

You don't really care about the valve count on the engine, you care about the horsepower and torque figures and the valves help influence that.

1 If you are not sure, gtfo of the building. Do not die trying to stop a fire. (You can stop reading here)

2 Is there enough smoke to cough or get red eyes? Apply point 1. Do not asphyxiate trying to stop a fire.

3 if it is just a very small fire start? Basket size? take the red thing. is it all red with ABC on it? Stay 1.5 meter away from flame and pull the pin, shoot at the base (1.5 meter is far enough that if you spray something electric, you don’t get a shock).
Does the red thing have a grey collar and a funnel at the end of the hose? grab the handles only or you frostbite your hand, get 1 m from flame and spray! Stand as low as you can, on your knees is better (to keep your head below the smoke, breathe and see). If any doubt arise, do point 1.

4 good job, now gtfo of the building. It’s still full of invisible toxic smoke.

5 if more action needed, send someone else so you don’t take a double dose of monoxide.

If you commit and you are a group: person 1 gtfo and call the rescue. Person 2 get the extinguisher, person 3 keep a close eye on person 2, if person 3 say gtfo, everyone gtfo. If person 4-5-6 are available, they bring more extinguishers to person 2.

It can be done at the elementary school level by anyone who can multiply and do remainder division (the kind kids learn *before* fractions).

For RSA to be secure you need numbers with hundreds of decimal digits, which makes it impossible for humans to compute. To analyze or prove the security of RSA is also hard math. But the core idea is natural number arithmetic, on the level of, ""multiply e by itself k times, then do remainder division by p"".

If a company has 100 Stocks on the market and you buy 50, then you own 50% of the company. Of course, companies have a lot more than that.

When you put in an order to buy a stock you are almost always buying from another person or bank or a fund or group. When you sell you are almost selling to another person or bank or whatever.

The value of the stock goes up if the company is doing really well and/or has a really super awesome kickass strategy to make a lot of money in the future. The value of the stock goes down if the company is losing money and/or they don't have a good strategy for strong operations in the future. That's a really basic explanation, because in reality everything from who the company selects to be CEO to how popular their latest product is to how easily they can get the materials to make their product to whether or not they're being sued for selling faulty products and killing people factors in to the estimated value of the company. 

Some Stocks also share a percentage of their earnings periodically, usually every month or every quarter, sometimes twice or once a year. These are called Dividends. So say a company aays they're going to pay 5 cents per share one quarter. If you have 1 share you get 5 cents. If you have 20 Stocks you get 20 x 5 = one dollar.

Finally, there are other things you can invest in, such as various funds. The fund buys in to a pool of different stocks based on a certain investment strategy. So they might invest in all the companies of a market or they might invest in certain tech companies or even invest based on companies that have high equal opportunity ratings. The advantage here is that if one company fails it doesn't wipe out all your investment, just hurts the fund a little."

- Space is not empty. From tiny amounts of molecules to radiation to microscopic objects (spec sized splitters from previous rockets for example) hitting the hull. 

- The sun. At one part of the day the hull is subject to the freezing cold of the vacuum. On another part of the day it is grilled by the direct sun rays, without the soothing influence of the atmosphere.

Since each body exerts gravitational forces on the other two based on their relative positions and masses, the math required to model their movement is insanely complicated, to the degree that no one has created a generalized solution for it, where you can just plug in the three starting positions and the desired time and find an answer.

In order to ""solve"" it (predict where each of the bodies will be at any given time), the current approach is that you have to do it numerically. This means going through, step by step, where each body moves from the original starting position, for a small chunk of time, then repeating those calculations over and over again until you get to the desired time.

It relates to the book mainly because the aliens live in a solar system consisting of three stars, leading to extremely unpredictable weather/solar/lunar patterns. This drives their desire to escape from their home, leading to their conflict with Earth.

More abstractly, you could consider that the entire plot of the book is a three body problem, as the entire tone of the interactions between the aliens and humans is driven by that single, initial contact. Like the physics problem, international/interplanetary/interspecies relations are highly dependent on the initial conditions.

As a *very* basic example (because naval engineering &amp; hydrodynamics fills up entire libraries):

- Long, thin hull =&gt; *vs* short, wide hull when it comes to speed and turning =&gt; water needs to flow around the hull ... so a wider hull needs to move more water to the left and right, while wile a longer, thinner hull does not have to move as much water to the side as it is simply longer. That turns around if you want to turn the ship. Now the shorter, thicker hull has it easier as it, compared to the length, have to press against lesser water. In addition a long hull gives you more volume for more machines, sails, rudders etc.

- If your hull is long and thin, you have a large draft comparatively  ... meaning that you still have to push more water out of the way. Balancing draft vs volume (and with that length and width of the hull) dictates what you can carry. What you want to carry (cargo containers, cannon turrets, passenger cabins ...)  and where then again dictates your stability on water etc (wider hulls being more stable vs thin hulls). The bow of a ship may be very thin, like a knife, cutting through water. But it means that, compared to the volume of the bow section, it has less buoyancy, so it can be a problem during heavy seas. 

In the end each of the shapes, forms, dimensions it is a balancing nightmare and you will always have to concentrate on a small subset of characteristics depending on what you want to achieve with your boat and ship.

Boolean logic is math for ""how to check for simple conditions"". A boolean is simply a true/false value. You have 3 basic operations: AND, OR and NOT. AND gives you a boolean that is true only if both of the booleans you give it are true. OR gives you a boolean that is true if any of the booleans you give it are true. NOT gives you a boolean that is true if you give it false, and false if you give it true.

With this you can make really powerful expressions, such as ""I'll go to the cinema if either Alice or Bob are home to do the chores, and Eve is at work so I don't have to be bothered by her"". This is ((alice home) OR (bob home)) AND (eve at work)

# Logic gates

There are some materials called semiconductors. They have a weird property: They're conductive, but if you apply electricity to them in a specific way they stop being conductive. (There are also semiconductors that are conductive only when there's electricity applied to them in that way.)

Semiconductors are packaged up in transistors. A transistor gives you electricity only if you give it electricity to both of its inputs. (Again, there are also transistors that give you electricity only if both inputs DON'T have electricity.)

You can use this behaviour to make AND and NAND gates. An AND gate simulates the AND boolean operation, except with electricity - there being electricity is true and there not being electricity is false. You can use a NAND gate to make an NOT gate (by connecting the NOT input into both of the NAND inputs) and an OR gate (by connecting NOT gates to the inputs of a NAND gate).

# How they're used

With boolean logic, you can simulate the rest of math - like the groundbreaking concept of ADDITION. And with ADDITION, you can basically do anything you want. The processor in the device you're using to read this comment is a mess of logic gates that can read simple instructions from memory and execute them, by connecting logic gates in such a way that every instruction goes to the circuit that can handle it (for example using the groundbreaking concept of ADDITION)

If there is 1-to-1 function in only one direction, say A to B, then that means A has smaller cardinality.

You have your ions just randomly moving around in all directions in brownian motion. This means that the ions are constantly bumping into and colliding with many particles (though mostly water molecules). Now if you look at the interface between an area of high concentration and an area of low concentration, diffusion arises naturally: A certain percentage of the ions in the area with high c will randomly move over to the lower concentration and similarily a certain percentage of the ions in the less concentrated region will randomly wander over to the area with higher concentration. But because there are more ions in the area with high concentration, that ""certain percentage"" is a higher amount of ions, so in total we see a flow from high c to low c. ""Travelling from high c to low c"" simply is more common than ""travelling from low c to high c"" because there are more ions in the areas with high concentration, by definition.

So, ions are constantly colliding with everything that's around them and that's what gives rise to the random brownian motion. But if we insert some different ions into the mix, nothing changes. There are still more of our ions in areas of high concentration than those of low concentration around it, so purely statistically they are more likely to be moving from high c to low c, so that's what we observe overall.

Now, all of this assumes that we can largely ignore charges. And that's often the case. But sometimes we do get large built ups of charges (e.g. in neurons) and then we do have to take that into account. A negative charge will be repelled by other negative charges, afterall.

You might have seen this in a demonstration with a van de graff generator, where unbalanced charges repel each other and make your hair stick out in all directions. 

One example of where you might see a negative (relative) voltage is in an audio amplifier. You might have your signal centered on zero, and have positive and negative voltages either side so your amplifier can make the signal bigger while still keeping it centered on zero."

Your example:

`6÷2(2+1)`

In this statement there is an implicit multiplication.  

But how to write this without using the implicit multiplication? There are three different ways to do it.

1) It is just multiplication.  
`6÷2(2+1) = 6÷2*(2+1) = 9`  

This would most likely be the one you would come up first. Just put the multiplication symbol in there. But it is not correct because...

2) It is multiplication with implicit brackets.  
`6÷2(2+1) = 6÷(2*(2+1)) = 1`  

This may not be oibvious at first. But it comes from mathematicians being lazy.  
Implied multiplications should be done first as if they were in brackets.

It is more clear when you do math with letters.  
Something like `2x/3y`. This should be read as `(2*x)/(3*y)` but the mathematicians are lazy and don't want to write those brackets. So they decided that implicit multiplication is same as having brackets.

Some calculators are not programmed to handle this correctly.

3) This is ambiguous and thus wrong way to write math.  
Slap the person who wrote that statement and tell them to write better math.  
IIRC some style guidelines explicitly tell not to do this kind of implicit multiplications because they can be confusing.  

Also the ISO 80000-2 standard says that the multiplication symbol may be omitted if no misunderstanding is possible. That is clearly not the case here."

India has the most distinctive system, where instead of separating every 3 digits, they separate every 2 digits, except for the last 3 (for instance, where we would write 123,456,789 in North America, in India you would write 12,34,56,789).

The other thing that you would see with different systems is how to represent negative values. This is going to vary even within a country between layman formats and accountant formats. While you might write something like... `-$1,000`, an accountant might write `($1,000)`.

For example, in Saudi Arabia about half of total water usage comes from desalination of salt water.

The reason why others don't do it is energy, and money. ""What you are missing here"" is the sheer amount of water needed and how much that would cost. Let's break it down.

**California consumes 38 billion (**[**38,000,000,000) gallons of water per day**](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2014/08/21/usgs-estimates-vast-amounts-water-used-california/14400333/)**.**

Producing desalinated water has a big cost range depending on the type of plant and how big it is, but it's something like [$2 per 325 gallons.](https://www.wired.com/story/desalination-is-booming-as-cities-run-out-of-water/) Therefore, making enough fresh water for California is going to cost **$233 million** ***per day***\*.\*

Oh and you have to build the desalination plants first! A desalination plant that can produce [100 million gallons per day costs $658 million](https://www.twdb.texas.gov/innovativewater/desal/faq.asp). So for California's 38 billion gallons per day, you need to build 380 such mega-plants, which would cost **$250 billion total**. Plus the $233M per day to operate the plants.

Oh and then you have to transport all the fresh water from those 380 plants along the coast to where it's needed. Water is very heavy, so shipping is tough. You either need to move 38 billion gallons a day in train tankers + trucks, or construct thousands of miles of huge-diameter pipelines across the whole state. I don't have numbers there but both options are $$$ once again. 

Overall, it's physically possible but just not feasible on the scale needed to actually help a state-wide drought.

There are environmental costs too, since desalination plants using a ton of energy also means they produce a lot of greenhouse gases. Going back to Saudi Arabia example, they estimate 25% of all oil and gas burned in the country is for desalination.

If you have a few minutes and want a pile of easily-understandable info on your exact question, I highly recommend the article [The World Can Make More Water From the Sea, but at What Cost?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/climate/desalination-water-climate-change.html) by the NY Times."

You've got some good answers already for other parts, so I want to point out that this is only true in some places. In other places, a majority of the electricity is renewable. In Canada, 82% of electricity is renewable+nuclear, Brazil 80%, Norway 97% etc. More importantly: in nearly every place, at least *some* of the electricity is renewable, so it's still better than powering your car on only fossil fuels.

Also, internal combustion engines are very inefficient compared to making the same amount of power as electricity in a large power plant. Even *if* the electricity to charge an electric car was 100% from coal, that would *still* be better emissions-wise (generate less net CO2) than running a car on gasoline. Not to mention with coal electricity, the emissions are being produced at one large point source power plant (easier to scrub) that is located out of the way (away from cities and people, plus tall smoke stack). Compare to a gas car with not only more emissions total, but those emissions are produced by cars, all throughout cities, at ground level. Also gas cars don't just produce greenhouse gases, they release sulfur compounds, nitrogen compounds, and ultrafine carbon particulate throughout the city too."

As an aside ...

I've been in the transmission suite at the Atlanta studio of CNN international although it was many years ago.

The signal from the studio was piped over to the dish farm next to the Turner ""Mansion"" and transmitted to various satellites from there.

For my work we were using the Intelsat uplink and the corresponding downlink in the UK at Madley. At the downlink it used to then be bounced up to the Astra satellite constellation for Europe.

So while a great deal will have changed since then, the studio signal will still follow a similar path as it did then. The delay from the studio to a TV in Europe was about a second.

The London studio feed was sent to Atlanta in a similar way, but was piped to an uplink in London using a high speed, dedicated connection. These days your home broadband is many times faster than what was used, but even 4k signals aren't that bandwidth hungry really.

The London feed would be mixed in at the studio in Atlanta, so the delay could be a couple of seconds if you were watching a TV in London while standing in the London studio. It was an odd experience.

All the feeds are backed up with alternate systems in case of failure. Although the London studio feed was cut off once when a backhoe dug through both primary and alternate fibres on the route to the uplink. They used another physical route for the alternate feed after that.

Opiates bind to the opioid receptors in your central nervous system, gut and other parts of the body. This increases pain tolerance and causes a decrease in the way you feel or react to pain.

So Adderall is 50% amphetamine + 50% dextroamphetamine, which in turn is (25% levoamphetamine + 25% dextroamphetamine) + 50% dextroamphetamine, or 25% levoamphetamine + 75% dextroamphetamine.  In other words, Adderall is a 3:1 ratio of dextroamphetamine to levoamphetamine. Since the body metabolizes each enantiomer a little differently, this gives a slightly different metabolism vs. a 50/50 mixture or just a single enantiomer.  

Lastly, lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine. This means that as it’s metabolized, it turns into dextroamphetamine. This metabolism takes time, making Vyvanse a slower release drug than Adderall or Ritalin."

If you have twins where one is male and the other is female, you probably have dizygotic or fraternal twins (or non-identical twins).

Dizygotic twins happen when two egg cells are independently fertilised by two sperm cells. Meaning that they have the same genetic relationship as normal siblings. So an average of 50% shared genetics.

Monozygotic or identical twins are where a single egg is fertilised by a single sperm, but then does an extra split in its early formation and you end up with two babies with essentially identical genetics. So you wouldn't get a male and a female."

* Migraine. The cause of these is not yet known, but is believed to be linked to changes in the brain and genetic factors. Currently the best guess is that overactive nerve cells send out a signal that triggers the trigeminal nerve, triggering the release of chemicals that cause your brain lining's blood vessels to swell.

The most trafficked line in Japan is the Tokaido line. Greater Tokyo has 36 million people in it. The Kansai metro area has 20 million people in it. They're only 250 miles apart. You have 56 million people who potentially want to get from place to place. That's not counting the 10 million or so that live in Nagoya and two and a half million that live in Kyoto along the route. So you've got all this customer base and only have to lay 320 miles of track.

A plane means airports. It means security. It means going up. It means going down. A 1h30m flight from Tokyo to Osaka means getting from wherever you are in Tokyo to Narita which is an extremely long train ride, then a flight, then a long train ride from Kansai Airport to Osaka. 

The shinkansen involves getting to Chiyoda in central Tokyo, just about every train goes there. You hop on the shinkansen. You walk out 2h30m later in Yodogawa, a short train ride from downtown Osaka.

Compare to the US. You drive to the airport because there's no virtually public transport. You take a plane hundreds or even thousands of miles to your destination. You hire a car because there's no decent public transport in 90% of US cities. 

Why would anyone take a plane if a train was as convenient as it is in Japan? You're in Japan so you don't need to worry about a lack of car from taking a train in metro areas. Places like the US on the other hand, there's no advantage to a train. You need a car to get to the station and you need a car once you're there."

Think of it more as the speed of reality.  If I make a change to the universe HERE you will see that change happen when that reality - moving at ""the speed of light"" - reaches you.

It doesn't matter if that change is a physical object, a light beam, gravitational pull, radio waves, whatever... the ""reality"" of it having changed moves outwards from that event at the speed of light.

If you were 1 light-year away, and I turned on a torch, you won't see that torch turn on until my reality expands out to meet yours, which will take a year.

If you were 1 light-year away, and I died, you couldn't ever possibly know that I'd died until the reality of my death has expanded so far that it touches your reality.  There's no way to ""cheat"" it by sending a message announcing my death ahead, it would only ever reach you at the speed that the reality of the event expands.

If the sun disappeared into nothingness this instant, being 8 light-minutes away, it would take 8 minutes before Earth suddenly WASN'T being pulled by the Sun, and stopped orbiting.  We wouldn't know the Sun had gone optically for those 8 minutes either.  Those 8 minutes are how long whatever-is-happening on the Sun takes to reach the part of the solar-system we live in.

This is why when we look back at stars, we can say that a star is as it appeared a million years ago, etc.  We know that because they are a million light-years away.  Hence the ""reality"" of whatever happened to that star hasn't reached us until a million years later.  That star is probably long dead and gone.

The speed of light is the speed of reality.  It's really the speed limit of the entire universe because of that.  NOTHING can go faster than reality itself, but reality isn't instantaneously everywhere.  It takes a while for the reality to catch up and expand out because the distances are so vast.

If you \*could\* go faster than the speed of light, you could actually get somewhere, and then look back and watch yourself leave on that journey.  And the ""you"" that left would have been able to see the ""you"" that's already there, before you leave!  It basically turns almost into time travel, which is paradoxical and therefore we believe it's just not possible to do.

You would be able to send a radio message to yourself in the past, and things like that, and we don't think that's ""allowed"" in physics without everything breaking.

The speed of light is just called the speed of light, light is just an incidental example of it.

Think of it as the speed of ""reality"" and it starts to make much more sense.

Around a black hole, for instance, gravity has so curved space and time that the reality of whatever happens inside the black hole cannot ever make it out the black hole.  Hence we know nothing about what happens inside a black hole and anyone inside of one knows nothing about what happens outside.  It basically ""chops"" the realities in two, and they never meet again."

All a graphics card is, is a mini computer responsible for processing and sending visual data to your monitor. So each graphics card has a cpu chip just like the main computer. In the last few years cpus have gained more cores. Cores are like individual brains inside the cpu. Originally graphics cards might have had two or four cores. Good but not excellent. So you put 2 or 4 graphics cards in series and gain more brains to process the graphics. Now though a single cpu can fairly inexpensively have six or eight cores. Meaning they can have just as many brains with less cards. The goal now is to develope programs to use the individual cores to their fullest aka multi-threading.

As a side benefit this means less power draw on the system because there aren't 4 other CPUs to cool on top of the main system."

The cashier or you swipes the magnetic stripe and a reader reads the information.  The information on that stripe really is just everything that's printed on the card, with the exception of the 3 digits in the back.  

The computer then contacts the credit card clearing house, which is a middle man (there are several), who then contacts your bank to find out if you have enough money to do the purchase.  If so, they send an approval code, if not, it gets declined.

After the approval, if you get one, the store eventually runs a job where it closes all open transactions.  That is essentially them completing the last thing they need to do to get the money.  At that point the banks that hold the credit cards send the stores the money for the products, minus a percentage fee, then they record the transaction in their computers taking the money out of your account (debit) or adding it to your debt.

The chip in today's cards are just an extra security measure against people counterfeiting cards.  I don't know all the ins and outs of it, but it has something to do with a rotating code that the computers have to transmit to ensure that the transaction is valid.

A muscle knot is a clump of segments along the strand of a muscle that remain contracted when the rest of the muscle has relaxed due to overuse/fatigue from prolonged contraction of the muscle. There are common areas where they occur regularly, because there are certain muscles that we keep contracted for long periods of time without stretching. Upper trapezius and medial gastrocnemius(calf muscle) are the ones that I find knotted up more often than not.

I believe there is a also correlation between long periods of isometric contraction (Where the muscle contracts but does not get longer or shorter) associated with the muscles that are frequently knotted. 

Stretching doesn't work as well to get rid of them quickly, but positional release, which is letting the muscle remain relaxed and in a position where it has some slack, for several minutes can. A more direct approach is to relax it and apply percussion or vibration. I use a thera-cane on my upper shoulders that has percussion in the end.

So the brain in predictable evolutionary lazy kludge just *doesn’t process it*, throwing it out as too much trouble to bother with.

So we actually go blind for a split second, but the rest of our brain doesn't like that. Instead it decides to lie to us, covering the gap by filling in temporally adjacent sensory information. With the stopped clock illusion the sort of opposite effect occurs, where you look at a clock just after the second hand has moved and it seems like the next movement takes a longer time to occur than it should. This is because the brain filled in the saccade with the view of the clock, making you believe you were seeing the same thing since the start of the saccade when you were actually blind.

Things labeled ""ground"" are mostly so there's an agreed upon reference for 0V in the system.  Just about every system has a ""ground"" terminal somewhere just so we can agree what all voltages should be measured to

The ground pin on outlets in your home is a *safety* ground, it is not supposed to carry currents under normal circumstances, its just there to make sure that parts of the device you can touch remain safe at all times.  Back in your breaker panel all the ground wires and neutral wires and tied together and hooked to a long metal rod that goes into the dirt, this is the actual ground reference, the ground in all your outlets is just for safety

For vehicles and other relatively low voltage DC applications, you don't need a safety ground.  There isn't enough voltage available for anything really shocking to happen so ground is simple the reference 0V point for everything in the system.  In general the negative terminal of the battery is connected to the body of the vehicle so we can define the negative terminal as 0V and the positive as +12V to keep things simple.

Having the frame tied to ground also greatly simplifies wiring of the vehicle as you only have to route a single +12V wire to many systems as they can use the bolts that connect them to the frame to provide their return path so you have half as many power wires running around which is a lot cleaner and cheaper.

Since the frame of the vehicle is all nice conductive metal it has a very low resistance, so while there may be a fair amount of current running through it there is almost no voltage difference across it so every point on it is very close to that 0V reference of the - terminal. Since there's basically no voltage across it there's no way to generate a potential difference across you by touching two points on the frame so its safe to make contact with."

TL;DR: Just the eye's rod cells in your peripheral vision pick up the flickering of lights. The lights flicker due to the power-grid using alternating current, reversing which way power flows 60 times a second.

&amp;nbsp;

The power grid functions with alternating current (AC).  Like if you would rotate a battery around, just very fast (60 times a second). 

This is done as you can transfer power over power-lines more efficiently that way (at least as it's done at the moment).
 
It's 60Hz in the US, and 50Hz in other parts of the world.

More modern LED lights may not show this flickering due to full bridge rectifiers and capacitors, changing it so 
 current flows in one direction only. Only some cheap, cheap LED lights just hook up to the power directly with some resistor and basically turn off half the time (as LED will only turn on if current flows in one certain direction - DC = Direct Current).

But old  incandescent  light-bulbs are simpler. Just a wire that heats up. And power running directly back and forth. 
 It's most noticeable in an old TV.

&amp;nbsp;


Your eye / retina has two different type of cells:

Cone cells. They perceive color and are most dense in the center of your vision. (And there are three different types of those for red, green and blue light.)

Rod cells: They dominate  your peripheral vision, and can not perceive color. But they are more sensitive. E.g. when you're outside at night, and seeing stuff at all is more important than seeing things in color. 

And they also pick up the flickering frequency, while the cone cells do not. So slow!"

The charge needed to send the signals is dependent on the movement of electrolytes so that is what determines how quickly the heart beats.

There are a number of airplane crashes which were caused by automatic systems doing the wrong thing during a failure without the pilots noticing or being able to override it in time. So if you want to install an automatic mixture control you need to buy something which is properly tested in all different conditions and it needs to be installed in such a way that the pilot can monitor it and if needed take over control of the mixture and the pilot needs training in how to do this.

If you're in the middle of the liquid, the forces pull you equally in all directions, but if you're at the surface about to escape, the forces pull you back into the liquid.

So to escape the surface of the liquid and evaporate, you need to be going fast enough.

What we call ""temperature"" is the average speed of the molecules.  Very few molecules go at exactly the average speed.  Most go a little bit faster or a little bit slower than average.  A few go a lot faster.

If one of those few very fast (compared to average) molecules gets to the surface, it can escape.  That's what evaporation is.  Evaporation happens faster when the liquid's hotter, because hotter = higher average temp, and a higher average means you don't have to go as far above-average to get fast enough to escape.  And more molecules going fast enough to escape = more molecules escaping = faster evaporation.

The reason boiling water is harmful is that it can raise the temperature of the skin (and the parts underneath).  Basically the machinery -- cells, proteins, etc. -- that keeps us alive is reasonably robust to occasionally getting hit by one or two fast molecules going way faster than average -- it has to be, because that's happening with water and other stuff inside your body, and the normal air or whatever outside.  When you touch boiling water (or anything really hot), the cells, proteins and so on get broken by all the molecules moving too fast.  Nerve signals detect the heat, cause you to feel pain, and basically tell your body to GET THE EFF AWAY FROM THAT RIGHT NOW YOU WILL BE MAIMED OR DEAD IF YOU KEEP TOUCHING THIS THING.  If you're lucky only a little bit of cells and proteins and such on the outer part of your skin got destroyed, and you'll heal up on your own in a few hours or days.  If it's a bad burn, you might be in for a very long and painful hospital stay, that body part might never be the same again, or you might even die."

Or, more commonly, if you try to sing a C and end up somewhere partway between a C and a B, you’re *definitely* off-key, because you’re not singing a real note any more.  

Remember, music is all about intervals between notes - a key is defined by those intervals.  Interesting music is usually made by harmonizing between different instruments - like a guitar and a voice, working around the same key - with room to occasionally break out if that key to create *conflict*, but that’s something that is done intentionally and typically resolved by returning to the home key.  

If the guitar is playing in one key and the voice is just not hitting any of the notes in that shared key (and in Red Dress, she really just isn’t), then it’s off-key.  There’s no musical harmony, just confusion.

And that’s without going through the nonsense lyrics, weird editing of the music video, actual vocal technique, and about a gazillion other factors.  Props to her for doing it all herself, but she bit off a lot more than she could chew."

It is located next to Europe, Africa, and Asia. As such, there is a wide variety of religious beliefs and cultures that influence the area. Often times, these religious beliefs and cultures clash.

15,000 Foot View: The area that consists of modern day Israel, previously known as Palestine, was once home to the Jewish people. The Jewish people had a temple in the capital city of Jerusalem. Over time, the Roman Empire conquered the land, led a siege on Jerusalem, and destroyed the temple. This happened in 70 A.D., and it drove the Jews away from the land.

Centuries later, the entire region, including Jerusalem, became predominantly populated by Muslims. Around this time, two Islamic structures where built where the Jewish temple once stood. Although Christians tried to take Jerusalem from the Muslims during the Middle Ages (the crusades), the city and the surrounding region remained in the hands of Muslims.

Starting in the late 19th Century, a Jewish movement (known as Zionism) began to take-off. Jews in various places wanted to re-establish their kingdom in Palestine, and many of them started to migrate into the area. By the end of World War II, there was a large number of Jews in Palestine, largely as a result of the Holocaust. The Holocaust strengthened the Jewish resolve to re-establish a Jewish kingdom.

Naturally, the predominantly Muslim people living in Palestine (Palestinians) weren’t too happy with the Jews taking-over their land. Even though the Jews claimed Palestine as the land promised to them by God, the Palestinians understandably felt entitled to that land. Imagine how white people in Western North Carolina nowadays would feel if a bunch of Native Americans started migrating into the area, attempting to establish a completely new government and claiming that they were retaking their land. Sure, the Native Americans got their land stolen from them, but nobody living there now was responsible for the actions of their ancestors.

Eventually, with the support of the UN, the modern State of Israel was established in 1948. Since then, there has been a great deal of animosity between Israel and the surrounding Muslim countries. The US provides a great deal of financial and military support to Israel, resulting in a great deal of animosity between Muslim countries and the US."

For example, you can start out with average intelligence and end up with below average intelligence at the age of 10 due to neglect. However you cannot start out with average intelligence and end up gifted later. Later in life, once you're fully developed you cannot do anything at all to change your intelligence level. However you can do things to make it drop (ie concussions, drug use, brain damage, dementia, etc).  **In other words it's easier to drop your IQ by 20 points as compared to raising it by 20 points.**

First thing that happens is that the acid is neutralized. The intestines have a huge surface area with blood vessels going very close to the intestinal walls. So selected content of the intestines will be able to pass through the intestinal walls into the blood. This includes water. So your blood gets diluted with water. Our cells does need water and will be more then happy to extract whatever water they need from the blood. But if we end up with too much water in our blood then the kidneys will detect this and extract the excess water from the blood and dispose of it in the urine bladder. The kidneys will also filter out other impurities in your blood and dispose of it the same direction. These other impurities is what creates the color and smell. If the urine is completely clear then it means you have way too much water in your blood and the kidneys are working as hard as they can to get it down to a healthy amount. On the other hand if your urine is very dark it means your blood have very little water so the kidneys do not have as much water as they would want which could result in gall bladder where the impurities is not dissolved in the water and forms a rock.

The Templars were denounced by the Pope in 1312, mostly at the behest of the King of France who was in severe debt to them and viewed the order as a threat to his own authority. To cut a long story short, they were hunted down and killed leaving only a few survivors. 

Looking for a safe haven, the knights travelled to Scotland. Why? At the time, King Robert the Bruce was excommunicated by the Pope and had no incentive to follow orders from Rome. As they settled into their new home, the Templars wanted to continue their practices but with some protection of secrecy. At the time, actually stonemasons would use lodges, signs, and passwords to protect their secrets and prove their proficiency in an era of illiteracy. Over time, the two organisations grew closer and closer. Fast forward a few hundred years, these lodges have grown outside of Scotland, particularly in England. During the enlightenment, curious gentlemen and scholars were drawn to the morals and dogma taught in these lodges, often with Templar legacy thrown in, and joined as non-operative masons. 

This is a very summarised version but yes, there are connections between the two but it isn’t overt and the growth of Masonic ideals in the last 300 years are much stronger than the “original” Templar influence from the 14th century."

GPS satellites for example have a very low bitrate. You can kind of get away with a weaker signal if you have less data to push through. So our phones can have pretty small, built-in antennas.

Antennas for high bandwidth you use to receive satellite signals are typically larger and directional. That's why you have a dish with high directional gain for TV or satellite internet.  And satellite telephones typically still have an antenna sticking out. It's not just about the broadcasting signal, but also the receiver. Dish antennas are very directional.

&gt; atmosphere

Also keep in mind different frequencies get through the atmosphere more easily. 

&gt; cellular can only  reach 2-3 miles

You have high bandwidth, frequencies effected by moisture in the air, and buildings, landscape in the way.  And much lower transmission power from the phone itself (few watts).


&gt; 100W antennas? 1000W?

Much less, typically. Keep in mind the satellites are solar powered.

Also you have to differentiate between the power they use to broadcast and antenna gain.

E.g. a 10W transmitter with a directional antenna that just covers one region is as effective as a 100W transmitter broadcasting all around."

The refrigerant is compressed. This raises its temperature, because the same amount of material is in a smaller space. That hot refrigerant (which is a gas at this point), is cooled off by running it through a heat exchanger (those metal fins). This cools it down to close to ambient temperature. 

The (now liquid and cooled) refrigerant is then expanded by increasing the pipe size. Because the same material is in a larger space now, the liquid cools down even more, becoming very cold. It then has air blown over it, cooling the air for the room.

Blast injury is a type of acoustic shock that affects not only your ears but your brain as well. This kind of trauma involves damage to the hair cells in the organs of Corti, which is in the inner ear. Blast injuries are common among military personnel and veterans who were exposed to loud sounds during their time in active duty. When a sound-induced trauma occurs, the person affected feels an increased amount of pressure in the ear. The blast waves that enter the ear may lead to injury and can even result in a hearing loss. If the acoustic pressure exceeds a certain threshold, the ear will not be able to adapt, which can consequently require further medical assistance.

It's not the cable type that matters, it's the protocol that you use to transmit data over it.

Fiber has the advantage that you can change the protocol (how the devices on either end talk) just by swapping out the Optics (the transmitter receiver gizmos on either end) That makes it a very versatile type of cable that you can run once and upgrade several times over it's life without needing to re-run it.

The biggest limitation of tradition CAT5/6 cable isn't the speed so much as the range. You can only go about 100m (300ft) with twisted pair copper cable before the signal starts to degrade. While Fiber can go for several KM depending on the optics (the laser module) you are using.

So fiber is better suited for long distance backhauls, and ethernet and other copper cable is better for shorter runs like inside a building.

So when you're talking about getting internet to your house you can't use a CAT5/6 cable because the run is too long, so you use Fiber instead.

Traditionally we've relied on phone lines and Coax (Cable TV) cables to do this, because the protocols (what the cable uses to talk) was better suited to long distance runs than CAT 5/6 and these types of lines were already ubiquitous in urban areas so making these types of cables do double duty made sense at the time. But we were ultimately limited by what speeds these types of cables could handle. Fiber doesn't have that problem, or at least it isn't nearly as affected. Now that internet is ubiquitous the cost of running dedicate Fiber Optics for internet to the home makes financial sense."

Switches don't do routing, that's the whole point.

If for some reason they don't know which port to send out a packet, they just send it out on *every* port (except the one it came in, obviously) and it's up to all the other devices to discard the packets not addressed to them. So, yeah, switches just have a simplistic method of learning what to send where so after a few minutes of communication they optimize packet forwarding from ""everything to everyone"" to specific ports.

The fact that saltwater (or toothpaste which contains NaF) doesn’t burn you is pretty solid evidence this doesn’t occur. 

As for why this doesn’t occur, it has to do with energy states, entropy ensures compounds will always move toward the most stable/lowest energy state they can be in, and lower energy states usually correspond with lower reactivity, the fact that NaF is much less reactive than HF means that the “reaction” (technically dissolving in this case) would STRONGLY favor the more stable (and more inert/harmless) compound which is NaF. Additionally it is well known that mixing HF and NaOH will yield NaF and H2O, in general if 2 things react “perfectly” (i.e. 100% product) to form a product, they will not reach the other way as the reaction is MUCH more favorable in the other direction and reversing the reaction would take quite a bit of energy.

Had this young man lie across two chairs, back down.  Picked a young lady to come up and stand on his stomach while he stayed straight as a board.  

When chatting about it later, he said the hypnosis helped him absolutely believe he could do it. He didn’t feel as confident after the fact, and wasn’t sure he’d try it again. 

Now, the professor stacked the deck to make it look impressive. He picked a young, fit, if not over muscled young man who wanted to stand out on stage. And if you watch a hypnotist show, it’s always volunteers because they want to believe. He picked one of the smaller females from the class, so the feat was a little easier. 

Would it have worked with a frail old lady holding up a fat man like me?  No. Hypnosis won’t overcome the physical limitations of the people under the influence. But it can help them get a little closer to those limits than they might otherwise."

At the most basic level you want a 50-60 SPF sunscreen on your face and neck even in winter.  Never use a spray as it gives uneven coverage.  In summer, everywhere that sees sunlight and get a waterproof one as you're likely to be sweaty.  This applies to pretty well everyone.

Beyond that, it's super person dependent.  If you have drier skin you'll want something that is generally thicker like a butter.  When they're thicker they usually have more fats which helps moisturise.  It's all levels though.  Many things can be moisturisers, it just depends how much.

If your skin doesn't really get dry, don't bother with a moisturiser or anything.  The less you use the better.

The most eli5 answer is: Use sunscreen everyday, no exceptions.  After that if you find your skin is dry, pick a moisturiser in a small bottle.  If you like it and it works, continue with that one.  If your skin is still dry, try to find something that feels thicker, if the first one you chose was too much, try to find something thinner.  And just continue until you find something you like."

They’re made when something new is found and a few cells are kept in our body as “memory T cells” until that specific pathogen is met again and millions of that specific T cell can be made when the response is necessary. Those low levels of memory T cells that hang around until they recognize their specific foe is like our immune system keeping a “list.” You can think our adaptive immunity as a series of specific drug sniffing dogs sniffing out whatever they are trained to find.

You can see this around objects with high gravity fields.  Best examples are so called gravitational lenses.  This is where something like an entire galaxy bends the space around it to such an amount that you can see what is behind it.  If the space wasn't curved then the galaxy would block the light.  By the space around the galaxy being curved the light from the objects behind it travel in a straight line, because that is what light does, but it's travelling in a straight line through curved space.

If they can convince your ISP to give them your address, or break into your ISPs database and get that address, yes.  

IP addresses can give someone a general area (like the city, for example) that a person lives in, but it isn't always that straightforward. I've been on government systems (which run on their own special piece of the internet), and their geolocation area ('geolocation' is just short for geographic location) sometimes shows thousands of miles away from their actual location.

With a neap tide the gravity from the moon is pulling the water at right angles to the direction it’s being pulled by the gravity of the sun, so you get smaller tides.

With spring tides the moon is aligned with the sun so they’re both pulling the water in the same direction, causing larger tides."

Here are a few:

EV motors want higher voltages. Battery cells produce a rather small number of volts, with lithium ion being around 4 volts. If you want 100 volts, you gotta chain 25 of them together. So you're already looking at making many small cells anyway.

Parts fail and die, or are defective from manufacturing. Making smaller, easily swapped parts makes that a lot easier to deal with. Less waste, easier to replace. If a cell is bad, a person can just pick it up and take it away. Not so easy with a huge battery.

The batteries need to be cooled. If they're made of lots of smaller parts, running some kind of cooling system through them gets a lot easier. Hot batteries are also prone to expanding, so separate batteries will have spaces between them meaning they're not going to get crushed so easily should they expand a bit.

Toy cars are on much smaller scales. 4 volts for power is probably adequate, and they're already small enough that a single battery fits rather nicely."

No. Time is a very real and measurable dimension of space-time.

emdawg3000,1629861198,pb2scp,I am vaguely familiar but still feel like I don't completely understand what labor unions are for &amp; how they work,explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Labor unions,"'ha8z9u8', 'ha8zgoy', 'ha8znsp', 'ha9023r', 'ha90566', 'ha9iibb', 'ha9yfrn', 'ha9ygbg'",8,"TLDR: Unions represent the workers of a company as a collective group when negotiating contracts and generally get workers higher salaries, better benefits, and safer work environments.

The basic idea is if one worker doesn't like how they are treated and causes a stir, the company will arrange for them to be fired. But if all the workers get together and refuse to work unless they get their demands, then the business has to take notice.

That's the basics of a Union, all of the workers acting together under representation. This is called 'collective bargaining'.

Workers pay Union dues which comes out of their paychecks. That helps pay for the Union reps and staff that run the Union itself. Often the workers of multiple companies but in similar trades are part of the same Union.

Unions can also offer strike pay, so a portion of Union dues is saved to give limited paycheques to striking workers.

The main purpose of a Union is to negotiate with a businesses on behalf of the workers. Positive things they do things like establishing better contracts, salary demands, clear rules for who gets promoted and when, benefits like healthcare and pensions, sick leave and disability, and demand better safety for the workforce.

If you are being mistreated at work you can complain to the Union. For example if you feel your work is unsafe the Union can help step in to deal with it.

Unions are primarily responsible for a lot of the benefits we take for granted today like sick leave, pensions, disability, health and workplace safety, and 40 hour work weeks (which is also attributed to Henry Ford but not because he was being generous)

But downsides of Unions is that they can become corrupt and no longer help the workers. If they are bad at negotiating they can work against the very workers they are trying to protect. Unions can also have useless people on the payroll at high salaries.

There's also an argument that Union workplaces are great for mediocrity and under achievers but not great for over achievers and innovators. In a Union shop you have to follow the rules and get promoted at set times and for set reasons, even if you aren't that good at your job. While non-union workplaces will promote excellent staff more quickly, but at the cost of having less overall benefits.

One bad example is that US Unions in the early 20th century were notorious for being in league with Organized Crime, the Teamsters union pension fund was basically used to pay for building early Las Vegas.

Another is the Sears Union were tricked into buying large quantities of Sears stock with pension money before the company went belly up. Which was an incredibly stupid thing to do and cost former workers a significant portion of their pensions."

Apple is on track to drop intel support entirely in the years to come. An external intel processor wouldn’t help at all if it can’t communicate with the software. Sure, someone could write a translator for it (the way Apple does when it transitions between chips) but then a fair amount of the processing power gets lost by the act of translating, nullifying any performance gains you’d hope to get.

Plus Apple’s chips are light years better."

If a judge makes a ruling on a particular motion, it _tends_ to become precedent for other courts to follow.  However, that ruling can be appealed to an appellate court which will present the ruling to a panel of judges for additional review.  The appellate court doesn't have to take the case, but if they do then they will hear arguments as to why the ruling was right/wrong and will make their own ruling on that decision.  Once an appellate court has made a decision, it usually become precedent for all courts in their jurisdiction.

Similarly, rulings from the appellate courts can be further appealed to the supreme court (federal or state, depending on jurisdiction) who can make a final call on whether the ruling was correct/incorrect.  Once the supreme court has made its decision (or declines to hear the case) that interpretation becomes the way that particular law/ruling is interpreted by other courts."

So you leave it open (unlocked) for normal driving then lock it when you need the extra traction. A ""live"" axle is like a locked diff, but it is permanently locked (often welded) so that both wheels always turn together. 

A standard ""open"" differential (what most cars have) allows the drive wheels to turn at different speeds. Great for going around curves but not good on a slippery surface because one wheel can spin while the other just sits there doing nothing.

A ""limited slip"" differential will allow the wheels to turn at different speeds for cornering but will limit how much just one wheel can spin relative to the other."

Its far better to let people assess their own skills and self select for jobs they think they are good at.

Democrats are the more liberal left-wing party. They support higher taxes, as they feel that money can be used to run government services like health care to help everyone. They support regulations on large corporations, saying that regulations  protect the environment and individual workers. They generally wish to increase our business and relations with foreign countries. They tend to support feminism, minorities, and gay rights. They want to decrease our military spending, saying that the money could be better spent elsewhere. They want to make immigration into the country easier. They want more laws regulating and controlling the sale of guns.

  
Republicans are the more conservative right-wing party. They support lower taxes, as they feel that individuals would then be able to save their money to help themselves as they see fit. They oppose regulations on large corporations, saying that regulations hurt the economy and make people's lives worse as a result. They generally wish to have the USA focus just on internal matters and deal as little as possible with foreign countries. They tend to support traditional Christian values. They want to increase our military spending, saying that the money is best used for national defense. They want to make immigration into the country harder. They want fewer laws regulating and controlling the sale of guns.

  
This is an over simplification, but that's the basic idea.

  
As for Left and Right, these are concepts used in many countries politics, dating back to the French revolution. In short, Left is for change and reformation, and Right is for stability and tradition. In general for American politics ""Left"" and ""Liberal"" are mostly synonyms, as are ""Right"" and ""Conservative.""

Gone with the Wind, Wizard of Oz, Casablanca, all of these are properly seen in 4:3, and when you went to the theater it would look like a giant square screen.

When the television was invented, they went with 4:3 too. It was a natural progression. The movie industry freaked out; if people could get screens in their home, they wouldn't go the theaters anymore. So they started making movies with gimmicks that you couldn't get at home, and one of them was making films wider.

It took decades for TVs to catch up; back when they ran on cathode ray tubes, it was probably easier to manufacture a square as opposed to a rectangle. But then the projection, LCD, plasma and LED technologies took off, and ""widescreen"" televisions became the next big thing.

&gt; Why not, say taller like our phones

This is the *least* appealing way to film something. Most of our daily lives, the stuff we want to film, occurs at our own eye level. There is usually not anything going on ""up"" or ""down."" It's side to side. If you're having a conversation with someone, they're *beside* you. If you film something ""vertically"" then you're adding a great deal of empty space above or below the important parts, and probably cutting off a lot of important parts to the side. No one would want to film anything this way and any platform or social media service that *does* do it this way is not worth your time.

&gt; why not make phones horizontal?

Phones are both vertical and horizontal depending on the application. We can do that because phones are small and portable (as opposed to a television that may be cumbersome to flip around), and because we have accelerometers that can flip the image without having to do anything else."

Instead what is usually meant when referring to a currency as being strong is that there is a high and reliable demand for that currency. The US dollar is going to be able to be traded for valuables in the future, the US government isn't going to collapse or cause hyperinflation of the dollar. There is going to be a demand for USD because people will need it to purchase things in the future.

There are two types of adhesives- additive and caustic (not the word but I can't reeebr the right one)
The difference is one type connects with the molecules of both elements adding a connecting layer thst binds itself to both elements. Think epoxy glue where you get a tick paste between the elements, here the glue itself is the binding agent.

The other type ""melts"" I.e. changes the structure of the molecule in such a way they can bind with something else - think model glue and how of you pull parts apart you get streaks of plastic, this type essentially. 

If done perfectly, with perfect materials and a 100% conversion rate theoretically you can bind two elements and they will look like one piece with the second type.

It happens a lot and for a lot of different reasons.  It doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you.

Please don’t webmd yourself - remember that a sneeze can be associated with deadly pneumonia, or with having inhaled some dust.  Tactile hallucinations are very normal and most people have them.   Nothing is wrong.

So, basically what is happening is that your brain has made a mistake.

Sensation is felt by your brain, not by your skin.   Touch receptors in your skin send a message to your brain, which assesses the message and sends a message back that says “I’m feeling something.”

You have taken the bracelet off, so your touch receptors have stopped sending the signal, but your brain is still firing “something’s touching me!”   Because your brain is the one that decides that, not your wrist.

It’s just a mistake, basically.  Your brain will work it out and fix it pretty soon."

The fields oscillate perpendicular to each other, so any particular photon of light has an orientation. That orientation is called it's ""polarization"". Our eyeballs can't detect the orientation so we can't ""see"" polarization but if you have the right kind of eyes you can detect it. Humans can make use of it by using polarizing filters (filters that only pass light polarized a certain way). For example, this is frequently used in sun glasses to reduce glare from some common surfaces. 

Ultraviolet, in contrast, is basically just a colour that we can't happen to see. In addition to polarization, light has a wavelength (the distance between peaks of the oscillating magnetic &amp; electric fields). We see a pretty narrow range of wavelengths...the longest one we can see is ""red"" and the shortest is ""violet"". But light can have wavelenths \*far\* shorter or larger than the ones our eyes can detect. Ultraviolet is one of those...it's shorter than violet and our eyes can't see it (but some animals can). Ultraviolet light, just like any other light, has polarization.

Not too much, not too little, but completely misregulated. In the frontal cortex part of the brain and the basal ganglia (the side closer to the frontal cortex) are parts of the brain that are highly responsible for attention. Dopamine signals from the basal ganglia to the cortex help to regulate which brain cells have priority messages. Too little or too much dopamine means the brain cell may not fire, it has to have the right mix of dopamine, serotonin and any other signaling molecule to either excite or inhibit the nerve response. The ADHD medicine is not contained to just the frontal part of the basal ganglia. Also in the basal ganglia, dopamine and insulin are being used to regulate hunger and motivation to eat. Just as the basal ganglia helps to regulate your attention on something you want to focus on, dopamine and insulin regulate the amount of attention you get for eating. This ADHD medicine is indirectly effecting the dopamine in surrounding areas which has different effects. Dopamine effects different parts of the brain differently. So does every chemical. Medicines often have a ton of ""side"" effects from the chemicals entering parts of the brain that are not directly related to what the medicine was intended to do. Since medicines have side effects that are not always known immediately, and since not all of these side-effects are bad, drugs intended to cure one thing often become more popular at curing something else by accident."

The reason our traditional representation of a gravity well - that of a heavy ball or planet at the bottom of a deformable elastic sheet - works is because the attraction works from the perspective of an outside object that is travelling towards the planet... from any direction. The 2D plane we use for visualization is simply rotated around in space so the object we're talking about (anything with mass - an asteroid, spaceship... light) is originally travelling flat on that imaginary 2D plane. The closer to our planet that object travels, the more its progress across that ""flat"" plane is going to be influenced by the gravity of the planet. Bigger/heavier planet, bigger dent.

Like any function, the Reimann zeta function takes in a value, does some math with it, and spits out another value. Inputs that give you a zero for the output are called the “zeros of the function”. 

The Reimann Hypothesis says that the only zeros of the Reimann zeta function are negative even integers (-2, -4, etc. ) and complex numbers where the real part is 1/2 (1/2+i, 1/2+14.135i, etc.). 

So far, the Reimann Hypothesis seems to be true…the only zeros we’ve ever found of the Reimann zeta function meet those requirements. But we don’t know why. And mathematicians HATE that. We can’t prove the hypothesis is true just by finding zeros because it’s always possible there’s one we just haven’t checked yet. We could prove it false if we find a zero that doesn’t meet the hypothesis, but nobody has done that yet. Or we could prove it true by figuring out *why* the hypothesis is true, which would (probably) teach us a bunch of new and interesting things about the zeta function and the distribution of prime numbers. Either outcome would be a huge win for mathematicians. Whoever does it, if anyone does, is virtually guaranteed to be famous (in math circles)."

It wouldn't reduce emissions and in fact would probably increase them as the engines would rev higher for longer this burning more diesel. It's the same reason we don't use hydraulic technology in cars even though that has been the standard for diesel construction equipment for a long time.

To someone who understand the game at this level, most games will follow certain patterns so if you know which opening both players played and you remember the key moves in the game i.e. where each player deviated from 'standard' moves, it wouldn't be *that* difficult to replay it.

fruitblaster69,1629311177,p6x2hv,Also how much of it is based on the cable and how much is based on the adapter itself?,explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How does fast/dash charging in mobiles work?,"'h9fslwc', 'h9ftb36', 'h9fthcc', 'h9fv7y4', 'h9j7ztg', 'h9k1rxi'",6,"Oversimplified:

Think of a battery like a big water tank. If you try to fill it with a small hose, it might take a long time. If you use a big fire hose, it'll go a lot faster.

Chargers that don't support fast charging are like the small hose. They only provide power to the device at a relatively slow rate. Fast chargers provide a lot more power per unit time.

Why can't they all be fast chargers?

The electrical components to do slow charging are a lot cheaper and less complicated than fast charging. Think about how strong a normal water hose is. It's normally rubber or plastic and can be easily cut by many sharp objects. If you tried to push as much water through a garden hose as a fire hose delivers, the hose would burst like a balloon. Electrical stuff doesn't burst like a balloon when too much electricity goes through it, but it does tend to catch fire or get very hot. So the ""slow"" chargers can be smaller and cheaper while the ""fast"" chargers usually have to be bigger and more expensive. We're getting better at making smaller fast chargers, but it's always going to be true that they're more expensive. 

The cable *could* be a factor but probably isn't. Cables are like the other components: send too much power through them and they could start a fire. However, cables are designed for what they do. So an older USB-A cable may or may not be rated for the kinds of power fast charging uses, and that's part of why the connectors are different. But since fast charging is typical in USB-C devices, that cable was designed for that amount of power."

Some hydrogen bombs are also boosted with a jacket of depleted uranium, which will fission on the fast neutrons released by the fusion reaction (so called fission-fusion-fission bombs), which would produce even more radiation.

Edit: I may be overstating the capabilities of boosted bombs, where I think it's actually a fission bomb boosted by a small amount of fusion.

Within a few seconds after the bang, the universe would have cooled down enough to where it was not making new elements and areas of mass could start falling back together due to the gravity but other pieces of mass would still be shooting out, expanding. If pieces of matter are going so fast that gravity can't stop them, and if there is nothing in front of them to hit or run into, they won't stop expanding for a very very long time (until the force of gravity had so much time to compile that it actually brought the matter to a stop). Think like a space fly trying to slow down a space fire truck by holding onto it and flying in the opposite direction. The fly is applying force to slow the truck down but it would take a long time and the truck would keep moving until the fly had enough time to apply enough force.

So, on the outsides of the universe you have a lot of mass that is expanding, its moving so fast away from the Big Bang, that gravity cannot slow it down enough to stop it just yet. More towards the middle you have matter that has either crashed into something else (friction) or slowed down enough for gravity to pull it back in and start crashing together with other matter to form large balls of hydrogen or stars.

We do take advantage of the matter that has been pulled in, not the matter that is still expanding. The stars give us everything. All the elements that could not bee created during the Big Bang can be created in the stars. Stars are like another little Big Bang when they die, except now there already are different elements besides hydrogen for them to start with because the Big Bang probably provided helium and lithium to the universe and when stars have helium or lithium and they explode, they can now form oxygen and nitrogen and other elements."

First, charging isn't really a problem for EVs. You charge your car at night, every night, so typically you start the day at 100%. If you need to charge during a trip, you take a bathroom break and eat during the charging. So for the most part, it very rarely bothers people. If you're commuting regularly and rarely do very long trips then the time when you wait for it to charge may be essentially never.

The second issue is that the battery is an important, expensive part of your car. And swapping your new, well cared for battery for one that may have been abused wouldn't be a good tradeoff for a bit less waiting. People would need to be convinced that this downside is really worth it, and so far it seems they're not buying it.

The second part may also set up some perverse incentives -- the best time to swap your battery for somebody else's is if you've abused your. And since you're going to swap, there's little incentive to take care of it. So a battery swap system may result in mostly abused and old batteries being swapped around.

It may be a better idea for some sort of industrial environment like delivery trucks, where there's central management of a fleet of vehicles, and there are policies and monitoring, and consistent practices that ensure that the bad outcomes don't happen. But you can't do that with random people."

It’s not always right, either.  There are some hilarious cases of mistakes coming to light.   

One famous example a couple of centuries ago, archaeologists found a peculiar, triangular object made of metal in a home they were excavating.   It was ornately carved and had two holes bored into it.

They came up with all kinds of theories to explain this beautiful piece.   Eventually they settled on it being a means of worshiping one of the local deities - that the holes were a means of whirling the thing around so that light could shine through it.

Eventually, the local people could stand it no longer and informed the foreign archaeologists that the object was, in fact, an iron.   They still used identical irons, and the holes were for the handle, which was missing.   And the ornate carvings?   Well, the woman who had once owned that iron had clearly wanted it to be pretty.

The short answer is AI &amp; complicated algorithms. 

The 5 year old explanation :
For a long long time, email providers (like google) monitored the behavior of its users. They saw how different people manually categorized different types of mail. 
If let’s say 99% of people sent all emails that contained the words “banana” into the spam folder, then it started learning that the word “banana” has something to do with the category of “spam”. Now take the word banana and change it to all sorts of different things like the people that send the emails, the length of emails, different links set etc.. 

Because they have billions of emails sent (aka big data), their algorithms have become really good at understanding what different emails are for different people."

If a body part is physically damaged, causing a tear or break in the tissues that make up that part, the body essentially just tries to stitch the tear back together by removing damaged cells and replacing them with new ones.

This is why it's important for each side of the tear/cut/break to be held together during healing; bones are set and put in casts, flesh wounds are stitched, etc etc. This lets the body grow new cells that bridge the gap where the injury is, reforming the damaged tissue into its original whole.

If a wound isn't held together properly you get scar tissue, which is where the body can't heal properly so it just grows a protective layer of tough tissue over the injury to try and protect it. Your body also really struggles to regrow nerve cells, which is why damage to the brain and spine or injuries that server nerves to our limbs or extremities are so hard to recover from fully. Your body can heal the physical damage, but it can't always restore full function unless the best care is given whilst healing."

The odds are calculated either very haphazardly (for single bookies working alone) or very carefully using what is now called data science (for large betting companies).

As for different odds on the same gamble, this can happen if the odds are not listed by the bookie. In many cases you can approach a bookie and negotiate odds for a specific event that they haven't calculated ""global"" odds for. In that case, several people can get different odds. Remember that the odds are not exactly the same as what the bookie assesses to be the likelihood of the event occurring - they may modify the odds the provide to punters in order to make more cash, by relying on various human biases.

Specifically it speaks to mothers and mothers in law who have been banned from their children’s lives, and pretend like they have no idea why.   They do, but they pretend like what the children say are the reasons are not valid or make zero sense.  Usually it happens with overbearing mothers who like to dictate their children’s lives, and who are often rude.    When the adult child(ren) decide they have had enough, the parent often loses their mind and seeks validation from others like themselves.   While the children often have a laundry list of what the parent has done wrong and have communicated this, the parent pretends like they never happened, or are seemingly nonsensical reasons why their adult child would go no contact.  Often they beg to be told what they could have done wrong, but then refuse to hear.

They basically partial block your body from reabsorbing serotonin which is a neurotransmitter responsible for a feeling of well being. As a result, your receptors for serotonin are forced to be exposed to an overall higher amount of serotonin which can have a positive effect on your overall mood.

Anti anxiety meds work in a different way. Most of them affect the GABA receptors in your brain, which are responsible for slowing things down. Alcohol also works in this way. It essentially slows the rate that your neurons refire. When you are stressed or panicking, your neurons are highly active and constantly firing. The GABA receptors slow this down and as a result, calm you. Alcohol also works in a similar way. Anti anxiety meds basically mimic the effect of natural GABA and active these receptors.

They may have to hire more people to produce more faster to meet demand, meaning they have to factor that into the price. 

And simply, they can. If demand is high, they can raise the price and because people want it, if the price isn't beyond what people are willing to pay, it works. 

Alternatively, if no one is really buying what you're selling, you can lower the price to make it more attractive to those who want it but aren't willing to pay a higher price. 

On the other hand, that same situation can be used to justify pricing low demand items higher: if there are few people who want it but those who do want it really really want it, you can charge a higher price. 

This is best seen in certain medications for very rare diseases. Often times they charge obscene prices because the people with those diseases really need the medicine and may even die without it.  There may only be a few hundred or few thousand people buying the medication, but they don't have a choice really.

The ear's hearing mechanisms lie deep within the inner ear. Sound reaches the inner ear in a couple of different ways. Most of what we hear is the result of air conduction. Things that make sounds cause sound waves that are transmitted through the air.

Those sound waves reach your outer ear and travel through the eardrum and middle ear to the cochlea, which is the fluid-filled spiral organ in the inner ear that translates those waves to the brain. Through the air isn't the only way sounds reach the inner ear, though. The bones and tissues inside your head can also conduct sound waves directly to the cochlea.

When you speak, your vocal cords create sound waves that travel through the air to reach your inner ear. The bones and tissues in your head, however, also conduct those sound waves directly to your cochlea, so that the voice you hear in your head when you speak is the result of both methods of transmission.

When you hear your voice on a recording, you're only hearing sounds transmitted via air conduction. Since you're missing the part of the sound that comes from bone conduction within the head, your voice sounds different to you on a recording.

When you speak and hear your own voice inside your head, your head bones and tissues tend to enhance the lower-frequency vibrations. This means that your voice usually sounds fuller and deeper to you than it really is. That's why when you hear your voice on a recording, it usually sounds higher and weaker than you think it should."

Having lactic acid in your muscles isn't going to do permanent damage, but it does hurt a lot. 

There's no benefit to lactic acid buildup. It's possible, and much more pleasant, to do both cardio (for ""calorie burn"") and resistance (for strength) workouts without generating much of it. Just remember to breathe!

As a side note, ""burning"" calories or fat is just an expression. Exercise requires energy, and we release that energy from stored glycogen or fat using chemical reactions inside the body, but these are not the same chemical reactions that happen when something literally burns.

The longer answer is that there's a bunch of theories. One is that humans like patterns, and music is a pattern. Because patterns are important for survival, it would make sense that they would release dopamine in the brain. This would explain why we don't like unfamiliar music; we're not used to the characteristic patterns of that music. It's the reason a song ending on a weird chord is somewhat upsetting or annoying.

Another theory is that it taps into the speech parts of our brain. We're able to distinguish emotions in speech, so singing should be able to elicit an emotion."

In molecular terms, your immune system can recognize things that it thinks are ""bad"". It comes with a lot of ""bad"" pre-programmed (like the lipopolysaccharides on certain bacteria) and it learns a lot of ""bad"" on its own (like from vaccines, infections, or unfortunately completely benign stuff that it decides not to like). When it encounters something it thinks is ""bad"" (like a molecule of of artificial sweetener in your case), it initiates an immune response. In this case, the sweetener in the intestines meets an immune cell who goes ""hol' the f*** up"" and sends out tiny messenger molecules. The intestines pick up these molecules and go ""OH SWEET LORD DUMP IT ALL BEFORE IT GETS IN THE BLOODSTREAM"" and pulls in water from your body to flush out the intestines, leading you to make an immediate, massive, wet bathroom run.

edit: My response focuses on an immunological/inflammatory response. Other users have pointed out other pathways that can clear the intestines like osmotic triggers (soluble things that cannot cross the intestinal wall and pull water into the intestines) as well as pharmacological (things that directly stimulate receptors and signaling pathways leading to evacuating the bowels)."

So if you happen to ever touch something connected to the circuit you are probably going to touch something connected to the neutral wire. Since the electrical potential between the neutral and ground is low there will not be much current in this direction. All the current will flow back to the transformer.

It might cost $100M to build the next 30 suits once the design is finished and then it'd drop to $36M/suit

Not unlike playing with action figures as a teen/adult or watching ""girly"" TV shows as an assigned male.

It's gotten better now to where Anime is a fairly standard media format in the went nowadays but a lot of the stigma is still there, which brings us to the ""anime fans"" you mentioned.

To quickly go over the MAP thing, MAPs are pedophiles, anime often portrays the ""loli"" archetype (girls who aren't necessarily underage but LOOK like children) and are often portrayed sexually, therefore it makes sense that disgusting pedos would watch that kind of content, because it's like legal child pornography.

But, that aside, it's true that anime fans have a reputation of being sexist incels, racist against black people, think they're Japanese when they're distinctly not, etc. This is a very loud but relatively small minority overall considering just how many people outside of Japan watch anime.

I'd say this is largely due to the culture of the country that produces Anime, and the individuals writing them. A lot of anime treat women like objects to chase for sex, and more often than not the average everyday protagonist gets the girl, because it's fiction so of course they do. Real life isn't like that, and often times these people feel slighted not by the anime for wrongly portraying life, but by the women IN real life who don't reciprocate and maybe participate in making them feel like outcasts in the first place.

In the case of racism, a big portion of the minority you talk about think that Japan is some kind of superior country that they ""belong"" to, and Japan has had a pretty goddamn awful attitude when it comes to foreigners in general, and black people in particular. Almost all these people are racist from the get-go, but that just amplifies it.

TL;DR Anime fans being creepy is a reputation that came about because of a very loud minority who have very real issue. There's plenty of perfectly normal people who just enjoy anime as a form of media, but the lack of trust is not unjustified."

Also those numbers (348 kj/mol and 264 kj/mol) are not true. It's going to depend on a lot of different factors. What atoms are being bonded, how many pi bonds there are around, aromaticity, and lots of other stuff."

It's because across a shock wave (or an expansion wave) air pressure, temperature, and density all change rapidly.  If the temperature or pressure change enough so that the air temperature is at or above the dew point, moisture in the air condenses into a visible cloud.  It looks the way it does because it follows the profile of the shock (or expansion in this case), as seen [in this Schlieren image of a T-38](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Shockwave_pattern_around_a_T-38C_observed_with_Background-Oriented_Schlieren_photography_%281%29.jpg).  While it's hard to see, the shock expands three-dimensionally away from the airplane in a cone shape.

It doesn't happen all the time, and you don't necessarily need to be breaking the sound barrier.  It can happen in what's called transonic flow, where parts of the airflow exceed Mach 1 even if the actual vehicle's airspeed is below Mach 1.  It can also just happen if the local pressure (local meaning at a particular point on the plane, not like local weather) drops enough.  If you're ever flying on a really humid day, watch the wings of the airplane as you take off or when turning/banking. You'll probably see a similar effect on top, especially near control surfaces.  

You may also see it in flight where some wing regions may be transonic, but usually the air at cruise is cold and dry enough that it doesn't happen."

This is a common misunderstanding of special relativity and its concept of 4-speed. 4-speed is the spacetime equivalent of normal speed (or 3-speed); it tells you how fast something is moving in spacetime (so space *and* time), and has to be the same from the perspective of all inertial observers (the basic thing we want for SR). But the only speed-like thing that is the same for all inertial observers is *c* (the ""speed of light,"" ""local speed limit"" or ""universal invariant speed""), so the 4-speed is going to have to be *c* by definition (the maths works out that way as well). But this doesn't really tell us anything useful. And it isn't *c* in the sense of the 3-speed of light we normally think about, but a 4-speed. It is a subtly different thing. It also isn't just the sum of the 3-speed and time-speed, but is closer to the difference between them.

In general there is no such thing as absolute speed (other than *c*). Motion (without acceleration) is always relative to someone else - you can always find a point of view where something is still (for example, from your point of view *you* are always stopped)."

In the public key system, the node holds on to your private key and makes your public key available so if you want to spend or receive Bitcoin, you can.

Now, when we're talking about nodes, there are (at least) 3 different kinds.

An ""SPV node,"" or a ""light node"" as Satoshi referred to it, *only* has the above functionality and does not hold Blockchain information itself. This has the benefit of vastly increasing synching speed with the downside that you (may) need to deem the entity you're using to get Blockchain info from reliable. You *can* check this data from multiple people (2-of-3, 3-of-5, etc...) to vastly reduce the chance of getting bad data, but you do need a source for Blockchain info.

A full non-mining node has all of the functionality of the above node except it *also* maintains it's own copy of the Blockchain.

While this is a more reliable way to verify, it also requires maintaining a copy of the Blockchain which is a few hundred GB at this point.

It has literally everything you would need to verify transactions and mine new blocks, but this functionality is disabled by default because if you don't have an efficient miner (specialized hardware with Bitcoin,) you will lose money to electricity.

The final node type is a full mining node. This is a full node with mining enabled. When it receives a new transaction, it verifies it, then it attempts to find sufficient proof-of-work to successfully earn the mining reward.

1. ""This bill seems almost guaranteed to pass, so I'm going to tack on something I want that wouldn't pass on its own"".  This can be fairly benign, representatives are often going to have local/regional issues that would have a hard time getting any attention at the federal level so they do their best to help their constituents by tacking it onto something larger. It can also be a bit sinister.
2. ""I really don't like this bill but don't have the votes to stop it from passing"".  In this case, they're tacking on something they know at least some people in favor of the bill would be opposed to.  Now those folks either have to pass the goal of the person tacking it on, in which case they can claim a win on that slightly smaller policy point at least, OR they have to vote against it, in which case the one adding crap to the bill gets to celebrate that they defeated the legislation.

The mechanisms were really intended to allow modification and re-review of bills in a negotiating process, but there's relatively little formalized as far as what those revisions could be.  The checks are basically in the form of minimum participation and procedural committees, but since the people in those have affiliations and agendas it's pretty easy for certain things to get through.  


  
Edit:  Okay I left out use case 3:  ""I want to pass this but I know damned well it will be unpopular"".   These add-ons are often used to pass things that wouldn't go over well and hide them under all the kerfuffle of the bill's main point.

These tend to be the smaller transformers out there.

There are two kinds of electricity: Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC). DC got its name because it's just like water coming out of a hose: the voltage is constant. AC got its name because it alternates between a positive and negative voltage, sort of like it's alternating between pushing and pulling. Most power systems use AC because it's better for large-scale power distribution systems for a lot of technical reasons.

The ""frequency"" of AC electricity is how fast it alternates between the two voltages. In the US, the frequency is 60Hz, in Europe it tends to be 50Hz, and I'm not sure about other regions. If a device has a digital timer, it *might* use the frequency of its power input as a basis for that timer. For example, a microwave designed for 60Hz AC might count 60 cycles of the voltage and count 1 second. If you connect it to a 50Hz power source, it will take 11 seconds to count 10 seconds!

On the other hand, mechanical devices don't tend to use their power source for timing. Instead they use something related to their machinery. For example, some microwaves have a knob and use spring tension to act as a timer. But they'll still behave differently at a different frequency. For example, a hair dryer's motor might run a little slower. 

So if a converter is going from 220V to 110V, it's very likely the power source is 50Hz but the device is expecting 60Hz. For mechanical devices that don't depend on frequency for timing, that's not a big deal. For electronic devices that do depend on frequency for timing, you won't get good results.

I'm not knowledgeable enough about electricity to know if you *can* convert the frequency, but I know enough to know it's definitely not something simple. So these transformers probably don't do that because few people could afford converters that can do this. I just had a quick look on Amazon and while I can find plenty of cheap converters, none promise to change the frequency. The only things I can find that promise to change frequency are pieces of lab equipment that cost at least $500!"

They are optimized for doing some specific kinds of calculations that need to be done many thousands of times per second to get your video output correct, whereas your CPU is made for general purpose computing, which means it needs to have everything available to it.

Think of a GPU like a drag race car, designed for that short burst of speed. It isn't going to do very well on city streets, taking turns, hauling cargo, etc. It can certainly do its one job very very well, but isn't good for the general purpose.

Now why they're separate in a PC is still another question. It comes down to two elements. First is consumer choice, being able to choose a separate CPU and GPU. The second is in design. Not every CPU maker wants to be a GPU maker, and not every GPU maker wants to be a CPU maker. They can each specialize in their own product.

Now applications like a console or the Steam Deck have different requirements. They are going to ship with the same CPU and same GPU for everyone, but they are going to be more constrainted on space and cooling than a traditional PC. However, they don't have the same requirements for modularity. This means they can throw away the idea of keeping the CPU and GPU separate, and create one processor that has cores for both kinds in it. This lets them optimize the physical space on the board, as well as the cooling, etc."

I went through a few websites and the range of CO2 emissions results was anything from 0.6tons all the way to 2.2t for one person for a one way trip.

This spread annoyed me, so I did my own basic research, and found out that the plane I flew on (Airbus A340-300) has 335 seats, fuel burn of 6.5t per hour, and a flight time of 12 hours. So a rough total of 78t fuel burn for the flight, and therefore per seat 0.232t.

Now assuming the flight was full (335 seats) and everyone wanted to offset their emissions and used one of these calculators, even the lowest website result (0.6t -ICAO) would mean that the CO2 emissions for everyone on the flight were 201t. On the other end of the scale using the 2.2t from Atmosfair, it would be a whopping 737t!

But... the entire fuel burn is only 78t for the flight, and the max fuel the A340-300 can carry is 148t?!

The weight of fuel is (almost) all hydrogen and carbon. That's combined with oxygen from the atmosphere inside the engine to become water (H20) and carbon dioxide (CO2). So for every two hydrogen in the fuel (atomic weigh 2) and carbon (atomic weight 12) you pick up 3 oxygens from the atmosphere ( atomic weight 48).

So weight of fuel = \~14, weight of oxygen = 48, the weight of emissions is about 3x the weight of the fuel. We generally ignore the water fraction but the CO2 is still considerably heavier than the fuel by itself.

It's only environmental because it has a renewable power source, power it by most electric sources and its a net polluter.  It's expensive, and that's also a problem.

However, the biggest problem is that it leaves you with CO2 gas.  What are you going to do with that?  They have this notion of storing it underground and hoping it never, ever leaks out.  Given the pollution caused by leaking oil/gas wells, this is just not a solution."

The truth is most of the pollution in the world comes from major factories, industries that pollute, and industries that harvest natural resources. If everybody on the planet started recycling, picking up litter, and conserved electricity we'd only be dealing with about 20% of the problem. 

So we'd see the biggest impact if we did something drastic like adopting plans to phase out gas-powered cars in 10 years instead of the 50-100 some places are committed to. That'd reduce more pollution than 100 years of not generating plastic straws. 

So the people who say it's a worthless marketing ploy are looking at that and they are angry the same companies who are doing the polluting get a pat on the back for pushing the blame onto individuals, who are not the problem. They should be angry! Those companies are the biggest threat to the environment and do not deserve a break.

But the fact is plastic straws have *some* impact. They do contribute to long-term plastic pollution and are part of the 20%. If we can find compostable or otherwise eco-friendly solutions, it would make sense to go ahead and use them.

It's one of those things like deciding to pick up one piece of litter per day. That's not going to save the Great Barrier Reef in any way. But it makes the world around you a little nicer and it doesn't hurt anyone.

And the answer is that when you make a nuclear fission bomb, like those dropped on japan, a tiny fraction of the mass of the uranium/plutonium is converted entirely into energy.

essentially it shows that you can convert mass to energy, and energy to mass. So if you were to take 1kg of something, and completely convert it to energy, it would release c\^2 Joules of energy, or 90,000,000,000, this is an insane amount of energy, and yo'ud never realistically be able to convert that much mass.

But, with a Fission nuclear bomb, you are converting mass to energy, just very tiny amounts of mass. But because the conversion is still massive, even a tiny little bit of mass releases lots and lots of energy."

It’s hard to tell when watching a game on tv (because you can rarely see the whole field and the umpires, but when a play “ends”, the fielding team has to get the ball into the infield (usually but not always, back to the pitcher) and then they call “time out”. This is the only time when runners are not allowed to advance. 

Time is back “in” when the pitcher takes the mound, ready to deliver the next pitch. That’s when baserunners always take their leads off of the bases. 

Sounds like Yelich got fooled by the old hidden ball trick. Did the first baseman pretend to throw the ball back to the pitcher? That’s usually how that goes. They make the runner think they don’t have the ball anymore, then tag them when they step off the base. 

In order for that to have worked, time was never called, and Yelich was not entirely in foul territory. The base is completely in fair ground, so if he was walking to it, he was likely at least a little bit fair. 

In order not to get tagged out when overrunning first, you have to get all the way into foul ground and return directly to the base with no signals that you might make a run for second."

I know from experience, because I once took a bladder pain medication that turned my pee neon orange, that when I pee it splashes literally everywhere. And if you've ever been in a public bathroom, you know that sometimes people have explosive poop. Now wouldn't that get on the novel of the bidet?

You also have the ones that are completely separate unit from the toilet. So what do I do there waddle myself over to the bidet with pee dripping from my vag and poop between my butt cheeks?

Tanwena,1628426102,p0dv6l,"Hi there,

I am having a discussion with a friend and we reached a stall as we disagree on some points and neither of us have the technical knowledge to prove their point.

The main question we have is: why is it that with modern cryptography and cybersecurity tech, no car manufacturer has yet implemented a way to prevent people from starting a car without some original (and irreplaceable) key (virtual or physical) connected to the owner? 

My friend's theory is that it would be possible to place the engine under the control of some sophisticated processor that stops it from being activated in absence of the right ""credentials"". Note: we are both aware of the fact that modern wireless car keys can be easily hijacked by capturing the signal as their design is currently flawed, we are talking about a case where the key's signature can't be cloned.

My theory is that if a thief gains physical access to the engine, it's relatively easy to physically hijack it and start the car even if the car's system is protected by some sophisticated cryptography - hence, there is no convenience for car's manufacturers to try to prevent car thefts in such a way.

Or second, some animations were done on glass panes, where you would paint each layer on a glass pane, stack them on top of each other with the background in the back, the character in the middle, and the foreground in the from. You could then change the distances between the glass panes to give a view of changing depth, or paint something that was truly translucent on the glass to allow the bottom layer to show through."

AgitatedText,1628354027,ozwi74,"So here's the thing - I am an absolute zero when it comes to science stuff and am curious about how it is that Jupiter can have liquid hydrogen in its atmosphere. 


The way I understand liquids and gasses, a liquid has less energy than a gas and would therefore be colder. However, I also understand something under immense pressure to be hot because the pressure reduces the volume that a gas takes up, thus increasing its pressure, as some other ELI5s explained elsewhere.


With that in mind, how would immense heat and pressure turn hydrogen gas into a *hotter* hydrogen liquid the deeper you go, which presumably would have *less* energy? 


Thanks very much for reading/explaining!",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Liquid Hydrogen on Jupiter (is it hot or cold?),"'h82n6sk', 'h82nhzl', 'h82ov34', 'h834zmo', 'h8370z6', 'h84vaji', 'h85lpik'",7,"Imagine two variables, pressure and temperature. The higher temperature, the more likely it is for you to have a gas at a given pressure. However, the higher pressure you have, the more likely it is for it to compress into a liquid/supercritical fluid, regardless of the temperature of the hydrogen.

In the core of Jupiter, the temperature and pressure are at a point where you do have liquid hydrogen. 

The main thing you have wrong is that you assume that all liquids have less energy than gasses. It is very possible for a liquid at high temperature and pressure to have more energy than a gas at a lower temperature and pressure."

There's a safety margin on both ends to keep it in the happier zone.

Lithium Ion batteries suffer at ultra low charge levels.  It relies on a reversible chemical reaction that builds up material on the ends when its discharging and puts it back into the liquid when its charging.  Every charge cycle some of the material builds up on the ends permanently and doesn't return to solution which cuts into your battery life, if you bring the battery charge too low it builds up more.  If you bring it too low it can drop below a critical voltage where it can never be recharged again, this is why your phone doesn't let your battery get to within 10% of its *real* charge level, the reported 0% charge isn't 0% real charge.

Overcharging is another risk because the battery will begin to heat up because there's no chemicals left to store the power in so it just turns it into heat.  Battery powered devices have charge controllers on board that will cut off the charging so you don't have to worry about this.

For the most part, people with wayyyy better information about the specific quirks of your battery have already designed a good battery management system for it so you don't need to worry as much.  Your phone is actually happiest when the battery is at 100% and on the charger because it cuts power to the battery and just runs off the charger power so hours spent like this are hours that aren't going up and down using up charge cycles."

As for humans eating grass you have probably not been tasting a lot of it. There are some parts of plants which is bitter and can be an acquired taste. However a lot of grass is not bitter. It does have an aroma which is not bad at all.

A reasonable person would agree that these statements (taken only on their own, in this isolated context) simply describe a set of circumstances and events, and are objective in nature. These statements are facts, not opinions. These are called ""positive"" statements.

From this set of positive statements, people will often continue the discussion of John's situation with normative statements, which are opinions.

Or instead, ""Although John's situation is unfortunate, he must abide by the terms of his apartments lease and eviction is completely justified if these terms are violated. The government ought to uphold the standards of the lease and not illegitimately prevent his eviction.""

- get food and eat it
- find water and drink it
- find a mate and f*** them
- stay away from biting and stinging creepy crawlies

Stuff like that which you're supposed to innately want to do, and where the urges arise situationally like when you're hungry, thirsty, and so on. The problem is, it's hard to preprogram these urges into a little developing baby, when the baby doesn't know what any of these things are, and won't find out for some time (many years, in the case of mates). So the brain had to come up with some way to pre-design itself like ""when you feel these hunger-sensations, go look for an apple(you'll find out what that is later.)""

For behaviourally simpler animals like spiders and frogs, quite a lot of the knowledge they'll ever need in their lives is built right into their brains from the start. For a spider, the urge ""Find a suitable space and hang a web in it"" is a complete instruction, because knowing what a suitable space is and looks like, is pre-coded in there too.

But in big brains like ours, our behaviour is based on our learning all sorts of complicated, nuanced topics which are built up through life experience. And the primordial urges tell us to seek out or avoid stuff which we have only learned about through that experience. Those urges, then, only acquire behavioural meaning at all, through that experience.

So that's what your text means when it says ""substituting abstractions for primordial goals."" All of the complicated concept-forming, association, psychology and cognition that goes on in our brains means that ""get food and eat it"" becomes ""learn marketable skills to get a job"" or ""have a favourite brand of gummy bear"" and ""find a mate"" becomes ""develop a *thing* for redheads in sweaters"", or ""choose the horny story option in this roleplaying video game"" and so on."

So basically ""quality-of-living patches"" to the language make it easier and less frustrating to use. One example of this would be the fact modern english doesn't gender nouns, because that is a hassle."

This allows your body to heat up, as it's losing less of this heat to the air around you.

As an aside, when you're hot the hypothalamus dilates blood vessels, sending blood closer to the skin. This allows the heat to radiate off of you and allows excess water to leave your skin in the form of sweat (which also helps to cool you off).

One circumstance in which this happened was in highly acidic or alkaline wetlands called peat bogs. The carbon was trapped in the bogs and eventually buried under sediment, where heat and pressure turned it into coal.

Peat bogs exist today, and presumably in millions of years they too will become coal-bearing rock. Peat itself is essentially a precursor to coal and can also be burned as fuel, and was historically used as such in some parts of the world, particularly northern Europe and North America.

As to what happens to a human body in that environment, they also do not decompose.

Though it is important to Distinguish water from food.

It is important to realize that you body never CHANGES water into anything else chemically, water is just necessary basically for all the other proteins and molecules and fats to float around in. Its why your body is about 3/4 water, everything from your muscles, to your blood, to every single organ is made up of cells that are mostly water surrounded by cell membranes with other stuff floating around in the water.

So, recycling water is super easy, because (besides sweat evaporating to spit coming out of your mouth, or the bit of water that is still in you fecal matter (which isn't a much, your large intestine pulls most of the water out.)) the same water molecule that you drink goes around, floats around your body, and then gets Peed out.

The only thing that changes water into pee, is that our bodies are using the water to get other things like uric acid out of our bodies, and it uses the water to flush it out.

So turning pee back into clean water just requires getting all the bad stuff out of the water.

Food is different, because our bodies actually chemically change food, complex fats, sugars, and proteins are broken down in our digestive system into simpler molecules, which are then absorbed into the body, but from there they can get changed a lot. Protein amino acids are broken down and rebuilt into other proteins, sugar is used for energy or converted into fat molecules to store, fat is broken down for energy or also stored.

our bodies do this absorption very well, squeezing up to 90% of the possible nutrition out of the food we eat. What is left in our fecal matter is primarily stuff that we can't pull any nutrients from."

The ‘rescue breaths’ which are no longer a part of civilian CPR, push air (with oxygen albeit less than they’d get in the atmosphere) into the lungs which then goes into the bloodstream. 
  When the blood, which is now oxygenated, gets pushed by compressions through the body, it oxygenates and feeds the brain, the kidneys, and every other organ including the heart itself. (Those three organs are the most selfish when it comes to oxygen consumption) 
The AED shocks the heart. You cannot shock a heart with no rhythm. You can shock a heart with a disorganized rhythm back into an organized one (think of it like pressing ‘control alt delete’ on a computer) once shocked, in theory and often in practice, the hearts electrical system begins to ‘fire’ in an organized fashion thus creating a perfusing (blood pumping) heartbeat.  If the heart has a disorganized rhythm, it quivers like a bag or worms and doesn’t generate enough pumping pressure to actually force blood to pump and circulate effectively. 

Most CPRs require medication assistance as well, which we give.  

The science on the meds, how much, and when to give them is ever changing. AHA CPR and ACLS (advanced cardiac life support) updates every two years and changes fairly quickly. Some things, though, like the importance of CPR never changes.

Your modern supermarket stocks more food than it expects to sell so that it can be sure to meet the demand for food. This creates waste, which means that the society as a whole needs to make more food per person but there would be wastage in any system of food supply.

As far as sustainability is concerned, the supermarket model is a pretty efficient one in terms of the way it delivers food to people. There are two main sustainability issues, pollution from transportation and refrigeration, and population growth.

Trucking goods all over the country in diesel trucks to supply a spread out population contributes to the whole global warming thing, but there are some interesting technological solutions to that on the horizon. Toyota has an electric truck trial going at the moment that looks really promising.

Population growth is a real sustainability bugbear. If population continues to grow as it has over the past 100 years, then we will eventually get to the point where we will not have the farm land to grow enough food. Experts in that field have told me though that population growth is falling off and that they expect the population growth will stagnate at around the 10 billion mark. With vat grown meats (will be commercially available in 2-4 years) and a rise in veganism (they take less land to feed, but more time to tell you about it), we can probably feed that many people."

That vibration goes up the needle as a sound, gets amplified, and there's your recorded sound. 

Sure, in theory, one could map exactly how a particular sound would cause the needle to move, and thus what exact shape of ridges would create that sound when it's played, but it's so complex to do something like that, it'd be easier to literally invent digital sound design and make the sound ypu want happen that way.

So is there a reason that he can't use the positive pressure ventilator? And is there any negative pressure ventilator out there?",explainlikeimfive,ELI5 Why can't polio survivors use positive pressure ventilator?,"'h7q2wsb', 'h7q370l', 'h7q3ma2', 'h7q4w4j', 'h7r6sqi', 'h7rab2d'",6,"The iron lung works for polio patients because they had lasting damage do the neuromuscular endplates (where the nerve tells the muscle to contract and do work). This happened all over their body to varying degrees (why some people were basically totally paralyzed and required iron lungs to breathe and others had unsteady gaits but were otherwise relatively normal, like FDR)

Us humans NORMALLY breathe via negative pressure. When we breathe, nothing is pushing air into us, our diaphragm and respiratory muscles contract that expands our thoracic cavity and makes our chest volume bigger. This creates negative pressure relative to the air outside our body that then sucks air into our lungs. When we exhale, we just relax and the ribs and costal cartilage and diaphragm basically just go back to their natural state and push the used air back out. 

The iron lung recreates this as much as possible since most of those patients were basically conscious but just had such poor control of their muscles that they couldn’t take adequate breaths. 

Modern ICU ventilators do work on positive pressure ventilation, by pushing air into the lungs at a set volume and/or pressure setting. It’s possible to overdo it and cause lung barotrauma but most ICUs are pretty used to setting them up and don’t set the settings that high. The ventilator pushes air in and this expands the thoracic cavity as the lungs inflate with air, and when the machine allows the patient to exhale, the chest cavity similarly just reverts to its normal resting position and pushes old air out. 

The problem with positive pressure ventilation is that you need a tight airway seal to do it. Either with an endotrafheal tube with a balloon cuff sealing off the trachea so air doesn’t escape around the tube, or say a CPAP or BiPAP mask that straps onto a patients face. Positive pressure and a breathing tube in place is unnatural mode of breathing and predisposes patients to getting pneumonias that patients can die from that if they’ve been on a ventilator too long and develop a resistant infection."

if you did that same exact motion again, but with the disk spinning underneath your marker where you still just move the marker in a straight line while the disk is spinning beneath it, when you see the trail your marker left on the disk, you’ll see that it’s a curved line, because the disk was spinning underneath it.

""The Cloud"" is just another word for ""Someone else's computer"".  Amazon, Microsoft, and Google all maintain some big data centers scattered around both the world and the country.  This scattering of datacenters provides great redundancy, you want backups in case there's data corruption, but scattering datacenters around means a big storm in Tennesee shouldn't take out your system because Michigan has copies of the same data.  The cloud providers also aren't buying a few dozen hard drives from CDW for their servers, they're buying millions of hard drives direct from the manufactures which offers them good savings on each drive.  Then they're building a big empty building with a single large backup power system rather than each server needing its own little one.  They're also grouping together tons of customers onto the same machines so each server is always staying busy, and if the main customers aren't using all the CPU time then they can just sell off the CPU time to others who need a lot of hours, but not high priority so their tasks can just fill in any gaps that show up.

If anyone cares.  

Researchers do not know for sure what causes hypnic jerks, but they have a few theories. Hypnic jerks and other types of myoclonus start in the same part of your brain that controls your startle response. When you fall asleep, researchers suspect that a misfire sometimes occurs between nerves in the reticular brainstem, creating a reaction that leads to a hypnic jerk.  
For example, it may be that when your muscles relax completely, even though that’s a normal part of falling asleep, your brain mistakenly assumes you are really falling and reacts by twitching your muscles. It’s also possible that hypnic jerks are a physical reaction to the dream-like imagery that accompanies them."

I’ve seen diagrams like the animation [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio#Radio_communication), but the more I think about it the less it makes sense to me. The AM one seems like it would work to transmit any music or other sound, because you can vary the volume to match the signal of the music, and change the amplitude in such a way as to match the pitch of the music, and all this at the frequency of the carrier signal. It’s easy to see how both the carrier frequency and signal frequency combine to make the broadcasted signal.

However, the FM one doesn’t seem like it would work. With no change in amplitude, you’re left with only frequency to transmit both the frequency and amplitude of the signal, while still somehow also maintaining the carrier frequency underneath. How is this possible? Is there a better illustration that shows how a signal with varying frequency and volume could be transmitted with FM? It’s further complicated by the fact that the carrier frequency is orders of magnitude higher than that of the sound you’re trying to transmit.

I’m not an expert but I am ok with this getting more technical, as it is a more technical question. If there’s any links to better diagrams, that would be most appreciated.

You are trying to recreate an audio signal at the other end. The radio wave is only transmitting one piece of information…the signal voltage at a point in time. It is not transmitting signal frequency at all, just a bunch of amplitudes. It does this very fast, and the receiving equipment stitches that back together into the original signal. And this works because the carrier frequency is so much higher than the signal frequency…if it was lower, you couldn’t transmit enough amplitudes over time to reliably reconstruct the signal. 

AM encodes the signal voltage in the carrier amplitude. FM encodes the signal voltage in the carrier frequency. Both are only explicitly transmitting one thing (signal amplitude). Signal frequency is a byproduct of a bunch of amplitudes sent in rapid succession."

A few companies keep track of your financial assets linked to your taxes, debts, and financial institutions. They track credit cards, mortgage payments, and several other factors that relate to your credit ""worthiness"". Each factor is ""weighted"" to create a single total number.

The ""importance"" of this function is because credit (and other) companies want to check to make sure you can likely pay your debts before they offer you money or services. A low score will mean that certain companies won't offer their highest value products/services (or do so at higher rates) due to the implied risk that you are not good at paying your debts.

In most cases, big items like cars and houses that must be financed will become meaningfully more expansive with a lower credit score, due exclusively to higher financing rates.

Beneath the liquid hydrogen layer is a 25,000 mile (40,000 km) deep sea of liquid metallic hydrogen. Beneath this, there might be a solid core which is about one and a half times the size of Earth, but thirty times more massive. The temperature here would be about 55,000 Fahrenheit (30,000 Celsius) and the pressure would be tremendous because of the weight of the atmosphere above.

The atmosphere is so large that it liquifies and even solidifies under its own weight. There may be a “rocky core”, made of heavier elements, there might not, we haven’t found evidence for it, we can’t see very far through Jupiter. But Jupiter does probably have a surface 30,000 miles or so down made of hydrogen compressed through liquid and into something resembling a solid.

From an economics point of view crypto is at best a store of value (assuming it's relatively predictable). 

I think my econ prof explained it best with the gold coins vs silver coins example. When there were gold coins and silver coins, people would hoard the gold, and spend the silver. This was because silver was relatively abundant and more was entering the supply each day. As a result of the influx, silver devalued while gold didn't. Applying this to crypto, we have fiat currency and crypto, even assuming that crypto tames volatility, it's still just another gold, except you can argue that gold has intrinsic value from being useful, whereas crypto is just a thing that exists.

I don't see what crypto is supposed to do, it's advertised strengths are, security of value, and freedom of capital.

However, store of value only works when there is relative stability, which there isn't. And even if there were, it still holds no advantages over gold. Additionally, transitioning to a crypto based currency system would mean national governments lose the ability to pursue expansionary fiscal (and monrtary) policy, resulting in every economic downturn hitting like it was 1929. The freedom of capital is also dubious since, the blockchain is made up mainly of large operations as opposed to the grassroots vision of people with their GPUs. If crypto were a mainstream commerce tool beyond a speculative thing, it would once again be dominated by institutional players like banks, and with a digital medium they can probably pull as yet unthought of schemes."

We have receptors for all different kinds of neurotransmitters that our bodies make. Drugs act at some of these same receptors.
These messages via neurotransmitter and receptor are important to keep our body functioning. And our body likes normal functioning. When you take drugs, you activate these receptors in a way that is exaggerated - the receptors really get over-activated. But our bodies don’t really like this because it isn’t normal functioning. So our body is like “wow okay I guess maybe we need to make some changes to get back to normal.” Usually it can achieve this just by elimination of the drug.

However, repeated use of a drug makes our brains go “okay WOW guess elimination isn’t doing the trick really” so it decides to get rid of some of the receptors in an effort to regain normal functioning (homeostasis).

Naturally, the first thing you’ll want to do is get rid of all of these mailboxes! Like, you no longer need 5, it’s just too much for you to handle.

So your body is like “okay cool just gonna get rid of some of these receptors bc clearly we need fewer of them to maintain normal functioning.” When you abruptly stop taking the drug, now you only have a few receptors and normal functioning is again hard for your body. (Like, okay now you get way less mail because you have 1 mailbox. Great! Except now that there isn’t this huge influx of mail that forced you to remove your other 4 mailboxes, you realize you’re missing out on 4 letters per day that you were getting before and oh! It turns out those were actually pretty important.)

It takes some time for your body to again adjust itself to normal functioning. While it’s adjusting, you’re brain has too few of these receptors for normal functioning, and it causes you to go through withdrawal. 

TL;DR Your brain makes changes to account for the high level of activation at certain receptors caused by drug use. When the drug is no longer on board, those brain changes cause you to experience withdrawal symptoms. Eventually, your brain will make more changes to get back to normal and the withdrawal symptoms will fade.

(Some details are different for different drugs - alcohol and nicotine in particular are kinda weird. But in general, this is what happens)."

Wifi refers to the wireless signal your router at home broadcasts that you can connect to, your wifi signal is limited in range (generally within about 50 feet of your router) and connects to the internet using your home internet connection, usually either a coax line or fiber. Some internet providers place arbitrary limits on your monthly data usage as an excuse to charge you extra money. It doesn't really cost them any more or less for you to use more data on a connection like that they just don't want to invest in upgrading any of their network and realized they could get people to pay extra money with arbitrary data caps. Wifi is a way to use your normal home internet connection without having to plug an Ethernet cable into the device. When you connect a laptop or a smart TV to wifi this is what you are using.


Your cellular data on the other hand is an internet connection provided to your phone via the cell phone network, those huge towers you see. The underlying standard that gets the data to you has changed over the years and evolved in part out of the old pager network. Edge, 3G, 4G, 4G LTE, 5G, etc are those standards. While those towers are connected to the internet through a wired connection just like your router at home they have to serve a ton more people than just the people in your house. As such your cellular data provider charges you based on usage since the towers themselves can only support so many simultaneous connections just due to the laws of physics so they charge based on usage to try and prevent people from using cellular data services when they don't have to and free up more resources for everyone else.

A custodial savings account is an account in the name of and owned by (initially) a minor, but is administered by a custodian such as the minor's parents. Once the minor reaches the age of majority (usually 18 or 21) they obtain full control of the account. Before that time any money withdrawn must be used for the benefit of the minor.

So you can't just leave the money for your parents; it isn't theirs and they can't have it. If you are actually over the age of majority then you would need to go to the bank and provide identification that indicates as such, so you wouldn't be listed as a minor any longer.

Vaccines are specifically made to not reproduce and will therefore generally not shed. However some of the early vaccines were capable of reproducing itself and a few of them were recorded as shedding from the host cell. This is part of the reason why live vaccines were discontinued many years ago.

However with the modern mRNA vaccines used to combat the corona virus we have introduced a different type of live vaccines. But what differentiates an mRNA vaccine from the earlier live vaccines is that the early live vaccines were complete vaccines with the complete genetic material to make a new copy of themselves. This was needed for the production of these vaccines in non-human cells. The fact that the viruses were able to reproduce in a human cell was not a desired outcome and was also quite rare. However the mRNA vaccine, although it is a live virus, does not have the genetic material required to make a new copy of itself. It is made by a genetically modified bacteria and the genetic code for making viruses is not encoded in the virus itself. The mRNA that is included in these vaccines is extremely short as it is only the single gene of the corona virus that makes the spike protein recognized by our immune system. The rest of the corona virus genes are not included, and no other genes are in the mRNA either. So these vaccines, although technically live vaccines, are not able to shed like other live vaccines might be."

The atmosphere cools down during the evening because mainly nothing is being heated up from the sun (there is no sunlight), but this takes time.

That means the longest it is dark, the coldest is supposed to be. Thus the end of the evening, beginning of the morning is the coldest.

Even if you see some light rays, they are still warming up the surfaces and that also takes a bit of time.

Based on your confusion, I imagine you are thinking along the lines of:

* Positive x Positive = Positive, ergo Negative x Negative = Negative.

But what about this?

* Like Sign x Like Sign = Positive
* Different Sign x Different Sign = Negative

Kind of like how like magnetic charges repel (whether they're both positive or both negative) but different magnetic charges attract. We could consider that a form of symmetry.

But let's think more into why a Negative x Negative = Positive.

First, remember that multiplication is fundamentally repeated addition. When we say ""A times B"" we are saying that we have ""A"" amount of ""B""s and we add them together.

So if we had something like 2 x -2, that means we have ""2"" amount of ""-2""s and we're adding them together. And -2 + -2 = -4, so 2 x -2 = -4

We also know that multiplication is commutative. That is, we can swap the order of the inputs and the output stats the same: AxB = BxA. So 2 x -2 = -2 x 2 = -4

So let's look at what we have so far:

* 2 x 2 = 4
* 2 x -2 = -4
* \-2 x 2 = -4
* \-2 x - 2 = ?

From here I think it's clear that even your ""symmetry"" argument would have the final answer being 4 as well.

I think most people have issues with this because we often try to think of Math in physical, concrete terms and it's hard to think about having a Negative amount of something. Like, we can imagine negative as something like a debt. And we can imagine doubling our debt (e.g. 2 x -2) but what does having negative double a debt even mean?

To help with that, let's break it down.

\-2 is just -1 times 2, right? When we take a number and multiply it by -1 we're just converting that number to its opposite. So 2 x -1 = 2 and, by symmetry, -2 x -1 gets us back to 2.

So for any Negative x Negative we can think of it like this:

\-2 x -2

That's just (-1 x 2) x (-1 x 2). Multiplication is associative so we can drop the parenthesis:

\-1 x 2 x -1 x 2. And we can rearrange

\-1 x -1 x 2 x 2. We know 2x2=4:

\-1 x -1 x 4.

""-1 x 4"" is just converting 4 into its opposite, -4:

\-1 x -4

And ""-1 x -4"" is just converting -4 into its opposite, which brings us back to 4:

\-2 x -2 = 4"

Even complex operations are done with many “on” or “off” signals (also said to represent a value of 1 or 0). It’s easy to tell what these signals are, so they will function even if the circuit isn’t very precise. 

Imagine I’m trying to send you a signal, the number 75, from across a field. I could shine a light across the field at 75% brightness. But it would be hard for you to tell exactly, was that 75% or 71% or 80%? Besides, any smudge on your glasses, or fog, would interfere with how much light you see. This is *analog* signaling and it can work fine with some circuits for some purposes, but it’s vulnerable to interference or error.

But let’s say I flash my light 7 times, then 5 times to tell you the number 75. 

If you can see well enough to know if the light is *on or off*… you can understand exactly what I was trying to tell you. That’s digital signaling. 

Plus, you could flash your own light to relay this information to somebody else and if they can see yours at all, they will also get the exact same message. You aren’t guessing what I was telling you then passing along your guess which then accumulates more errors. Small variations don’t have *any* effect on a digital signal, so many small errors don’t add up over time. 

So a digital circuit can have some significant errors or interference and it will still be able to function. Only a very large error could make it think an on signal is actually off, or visa versa."

At low heights, say 5 or 10 meters, while you will certainly feel the impact, the water has enough time to be pushed out of the way by your body, slowing you down in the process. However, the further you fall, the harder the impact.  


Now, most of the deceleration takes place upon impact. Most of the energy is absorbed by the water when you first drop in. This is where you experience the most dramatic deceleration. And the deceleration is what kills you here. And the further you fall, the faster you are moving, and the stronger the initial deceleration upon impact is, and it is this deceleration that breaks your bones.   


Its why falling from 10 meters height onto concrete is pretty much a guaranteed way to break your bones, but falling 10 meters into a sufficiently deep pool might leave you with reddened skin, but no serious injuries. Unlike water, concrete doesnt tend to move out of the way upon impact. You experience all the impact force at once, rather than being slowed down over several seconds.  


Thing is though, this only works to a degree. If your speed is high enough, that initial impact will still peak at a value where it can break your bones.

The act of applying a force doesn't expend energy - its the act of applying a force over a distance which does.

In the real world, since everything is elastic, the thing you are compressing/stretching with your forces, plus the structure that the forces are reacting against will act like stiff springs - and this is where the energy gets stored.

For example press your hands together in front of your chest. As you press:

* Some energy gets stored into the squishing of your palms

* Some energy gets stored in the compression of the bones in your forearms

* Some energy gets stored in the tension of your upper arms and the bones across your shoulders

The chances are some energy will be lost to heat, since flesh is unlikely to be a particularly efficient elastic. 

Since you don't apply the force over much distance, very little energy is stored. If you put a spring between your hands, now you apply the force over more distance and more energy is stored (which is apparent when you let the spring go!)"

More or less lift from the tail rotor can allow you to yaw the helicopter left or right.

The main rotor works by changing the angle of attack of each blade as they move around the hub. By increasing lift on one side, and not on the other, you can tilt the entire helicopter left, right, nose up, or nose down. Then by changing the lift of the blades collectively (using the collective) you can create overall lift that lifts the helicopter up, or drops it down."

It’s like asking “what is space?” We all sort of vaguely understand it intuitively, but it’s not exactly a thing you can explain. We can describe its behaviour and interactions with math and physics, but those don’t tell you what it is. 

That said, I’ll try to elucidate a bit. 

So, you know how there are 3 spatial dimensions? You can move forward and backward (that’s 1), you can move up and down (that’s 2) and you can move left and right (3 dimensions). 

Time is a fourth dimension. You can move along the time axis. 

That’s not just an abstraction either. You know how if you turn 90 degrees, your “forward and backward” dimension will turn into your “left and right” dimension, and the “left/right” dimension will become your “forward/backward” dimension?

The same thing happens with time. You can sort of “rotate” in spacetime to turn some of your time into space, and vice-versa. 

More precisely, the more you move through space (aka, the faster you travel), the less you move through time. Once you reach the speed of light (the fastest possible speed) all of your motion is entirely through space, and you don’t move through time at all. (This is why you may hear people say that light experiences no time). 

So, at this point, it might seem like time is just another space dimension that we should be able to walk through, and I mean, in a way it is. We can convert it into space by changing our speed and such, but there are some differences. 

Firstly, as you may have noticed, we only move in one direction through time. It’s possible to see other locations go back in time, and it’s theoretically possible to travel into the past inside a black hole, but for you specifically, time will keep flowing forwards. You can’t go back to being younger you, you will always keep aging forward. No one really knows why, although there are theories that it’s related to entropy. 

The other main difference is how time behaves geometrically. If you’ve seen the Pythagorean theorem before, you probably know that the total distance between two points is the square root of the sum of all the squares of the differences in their dimensions. (`Sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)`). Time is sort of the opposite. To get the “distance” (called the spacetime interval) between two events, you *subtract* the square of time. (`sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - t^2)`). The effects of this aren’t super important here, but it’s just another way time is different from space. 

**Tl;DR:** No one really knows. Time is sort of like another dimension of space, except it has some weird behaviour that makes it not. But sort of

**Edit:** *I’d like to add that my personal favourite theory for why we always move forward in time is that we don’t. General Relativity sort of implies that time doesn’t move at all. All of spacetime is just a static 4-dimensional geometry that never changes. This would mean that we aren’t travelling through time. We are instead at every point in time, always (the concept of a timeline. There’s an infinite line of “you”s throughout time). The only reason it feels like time is moving is because of our memories. Think about it. How do you know you’re moving through time? Because you have memories of the previous instants. So, there’s no real way to tell whether you’re ACTUALLY moving through time, or whether you’re frozen in time with the exact memories that make it seem like you’re moving through time.*"

Humans can actually do this with vitamin D, we produce vitamin D by standing in sunlight. Which is also believed to be part of the reason for the lighter skin tone of Caucasians. Europeans likely evolved that way during the last ice age to absorb more sunlight due to the lack of vitamin D in our diet while people of African decent kept a darker skin tone to ward off sunburn and skin cancer in the lower and sunnier latitudes.

The trade off for animals like cows and deer is that while grasses are very easy to find and consume, eating grass doesn't give you nearly as much energy as eating meat. So they spend all day eating and they have tiny brains compared to ours.

Having our large brains forces us to eat far more calories which we can only get from eating meat, starches like grain, and sugar."

Ideally we'd want to put in airpumps as well, which use energy and therefore release CO2, to aerate the water and speed up growth, and as a bare minimum we'd need water pumps constantly adding water to offset evaporation. Which requires more energy, and more CO2.

Large herbivores often don't break down their food themselves with acids and enzymes. Instead, they have a gut full of microbes that do this and the microbes produce the lipids, proteins and other nutrients that the herbivores eat.

Stomachs also aren't big water balloons full of acid. Organisms produce digestive acid as needed and then produce counter agents that neutralize the acid as soon as this part of digestion is done.

And while the acids are strong, it's not like a horror movie where a splash of stomach acid will instantly dissolve whatever it touches. When you throw up, you can feel the burn of the acid in your throat and mouth, it's irritating but you're not dissolving yourself into goo on the spot.

So what it adds up to is that herbivores often have less powerful stomach acids because they digest differently. There's not that much acid in a stomach at any given time. If you rip open a stomach, much of it will leak out of it anyway.

Half digested stomach contents are often quite nutritionally valuable for predators. Meat is just muscle, fat, protein etc. If predators only ate muscle meat, they'd run a major nutritional deficit. It's the prey animals bones and organs that provide predators with much of their vitamins and minerals."

Starting in the 1970s, though, the success of pre-teen prodigies like Nadia Comaneci &amp; Dominique Moceanu made people started a culture shift towards preferring slender, young, usually prepubescent girls as gymnasts. This was partly visual (the girls were described as “nymphs” and “fairies”, flitting about on the floor, and people thought that looked cool) and partly because coaches decided, pretty arbitrarily, that small, slender girls were easier to coach and overall better gymnasts. 

Two factors must be considered, however: one, even in an era where youth and smallness were preferred, older gymnasts still found success. They were just usually from programs that didn’t have the same “depth” (I.e. number of potential world-class gymnasts), and these women would compete for up to several Olympic cycles.

Conversely, most of the small “pixie” gymnasts whose body types and ages were considered ideal came (to my knowledge) from countries with lots of depth, where there was always another prepubescent wonder kid to replace them if they faltered. They were (IMO) a little disposable; elite gymnastics tended to be a meat grinder for them, and they often tended to injure themselves out of contention, in part because their coaches tended to starve them in order to keep them from going through puberty and preserve that “ideal” body type, while training them harshly full-time. 

So older gymnasts have always been successful, but the average age of gymnasts has *really* started to recover to a reasonable level in the last decade or so, as gymnastics has had something of a reckoning with abusive coaching practices, focus on weight leading to eating disorders, etc. The sport has also really started to discover the benefits of training smarter, not harder, which makes the sport a bit less hard on the body, which is great for everyone, but especially for girls wanting to have a longer career in gymnastics 

Of course, the sport has *also* evolved to be a bit more tumbling-heavy, which favors powerful gymnasts, who tend to be older, and medical and athletic training techniques have also gotten *way* better to help gymnasts maintain peak performance, and even get better and better, over multiple Olympic cycles. 

As a consequence of that, all of the medalists at this Olympics have been grown women (18+) with many more competitors (Ellie Seitz, Giulia Steingruber, Elsabeth Black, Simone Biles, ed: Kim Bui, who was an AA finalist at 32, etc.) who are in their mid to late twenties. It’s an encouraging and welcome sign for the sport! 

So all of that being said, Nina has great technique and form, the benefit of excellent coaching and medical/athletic training care, a changing culture that accepts and celebrates older competitors, seemingly a *very* smart coaching staff who have paced her training well, and world class talent to fall back on— so although she may take a year or two off, as many gymnasts do after the Olympics, it is entirely feasible that she could continue onwards for the next Olympics, and even the one after that! This may have been the only time that Nina really had a chance to medal *at this Olympics* (true; she was a very outside chance for the AA competition, but bars is her specialty), but if that commentator was suggesting that this is her only chance to get an Olympic medal ever, then he’s full of shit lol.

ETA: I cannot believe that I forgot to mention Chellsie Memmel, 2005 World Champion and 2008 Olympian, who returned to gymnastics after a 10+ year break during the pandemic and has resumed training (the QUEEN of “train smarter, not harder”) with the aim of attending Worlds 2021/22 as a member of the USA team… *at the age of 32*. And based on her training videos (she has a YouTube channel) she has a *really* good shot if she keeps progressing at her current pace."

That doesn't mean they don't have mass(-energy) in a relativistic sense.

In relativity, mass and energy are two forms of the same thing (hereafter I'm going to use ""energy"" for simplicity, but ""energy"" in that sense is what creates gravity in relativity). You may be familiar with the equation E = mc^(2), but that's actually only for a particle at rest (which protons, of course, never are). The full formula is E^2 = (mc^(2))^2 + (pc)^(2), where *m* is the rest mass (if any), *c* is the speed of light, and *p* is the momentum.

For a photon, the rest mass *m* is 0. But photons *do* have momentum (given by p = (planck's constant)/(wavelength)). And so the energy (and therefore, in a relativistic sense, mass) of a photon is not zero, and it interacts with gravity the same way everything else does. Or, if you prefer, the energy of a photon is of course not zero, and because energy and mass (in a gravitational sense) are equivalent, its gravitational ""mass"" is also not zero.

In particular, you're about to get a lot of ""because gravity is just curved space"" responses that aren't telling the whole story. Photons don't just *feel* gravitational fields, they *generate* them themselves. That said, in practice, the mass-energy of a photon is so tiny as to be effectively negligible relative to just about any particle with rest mass: a photon of visible light, for example, has energy ~4 x 10^-19 J, while an electron has rest mass-energy of about 8 x 10^-14 J (that is, about 200,000 times larger).

(In fact it gets worse, because mass-energy actually *isn't* the only thing that generates gravitational fields in relativity. The ultimate source of gravitational fields, the [stress-energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor), is also affected by the *movement* of mass-energy.)"

Soon your dam tech gets pretty sophisticated, and more importantly, it gets smaller! So you can have little dams at every stage in the stream, and there are channels of water between the dams that communicate: so you can have, say, a flag that raises if Stream 1 has water but Stream 2 doesn't; or only if Stream 1 and Stream 2 have water; or if either do. You'll eventually need more streams to make the most of the possibilities here - calculations! - but that's fine because the head dam is filling up way faster than you could ever let the water out. Eventually you might have millions of streams.

When you hit the shutter, the ""click"" you hear is that mirror moving out of the way so that light can now hit the sensor.  That's why the viewfinder goes dark when you hit the shutter: because the mirror was the only thing letting you see through the lens. You can see that mirror when you take the lens off the body of a DSLR.

Mirrorless cameras use electronics to both look through the lense and to capture the light from that lense. You can see it when you take your lens off the body of a mirrorless camera. This is also why mirrorless cameras don't have a click unless the manufacturer put one in there artificially since people are used to it.  It's also why they are so fast; since there is no physical mirror to move inside the body."

Chips have a lot of starches, which really love binding with moisture. As it sits out, moisture in the air settles on the chips and the starches absorb it. And because chips are fried, all the moisture inside them is already gone, which means reintroducing moisture makes them go all soft. Bread goes hard because it already has almost the maximum amount of moisture inside it, so instead of absorbing more moisture, the starches start to crystallize, making it go hard.

Jerky doesn't have any starch in it, it's just dehydrated meat. If it's been dehydrated correctly and stored and kept in an airtight environment, it'll never go stale. There's just nothing there to spoil, unless some bacteria is introduced that causes mold. If it's not been handled correctly, any remaining moisture will work its way out of the meat, causing it to go hard."
Intelligent_Hat_5693,1627753900,ovbnys,Why is the platypus such a mix of mammal and reptile? Where did this strange mix of characteristics come from?

Mammals are just a sub-category of reptiles that got warm and furry for some reason. Dinosaurs are another subset of reptile, and birds are too since birds are just a subset of dinosaurs. And of course, reptiles are just a subset of four-legged vertebrates, which are a subset of bony fish, which are a subset of vertebrates. 

Categories of animals are colloquial. We group them together based on shared traits like having scaly skin, but if we were to categorise them properly, we'd do it by evolutionary relationship, and a species can never evolve out of its membership of its ancestral group, because this system of categorisation is one in which each segment always belongs to a larger class defined by its most recent common ancestor, like how humans are also primates, a category of species that all share a particular common ancestor. 

Because this is evolution, these species don't just spontaneously arise with different traits. They emerge from repeated mutation away from those common ancestors, and retain most of the same stuff those ancestors have - for example, every mammal still has the core body plan of a four-legged vertebrate, but in some cases, mutations have obscured this structure (in whales for example, the front limbs have become fused flippers instead of feet, and the back limbs have shrunk to the point of being just clusters of useless bone). We think that monotremes like the platypus probably diverged from the mammal line before the shift to live births in the mammalian mainstream, but after the development of some other notable mammalian traits. That is - the platypus and other mammals share a most recent common ancestor that laid eggs, with the therian mammals going ""y'know what I'd rather squeeze out a weird tiny version of myself than an egg""."

I know of a few people that hide crypto ASIC miners in active server rooms to effectively steal power from the companies they work for, or are the company owners themselves and don't care because power is an operating expense for their business.

The Philippines for example have made it illegal to mine coins because the current draw is so much that it overloads their power grid. They've made examples of miners by crushing their video cars and ASIC miners with a steam roller in public.

While in Canada I'm aware of at least one crypto mining operation that uses the waste heat to heat up a legal Marijuana grow-op. This company specializes in making money on fringe and grey area businesses.

But a lot of the cash these days comes from the trading. Making the coins is one thing, knowing when to buy/sell is the other part of it.

Then factor in that while some places have dependable solar, those tend to by dry places (no clouds), and often flat. The sort of places you can use pumped storage can't depend on the sun, so they'd have to massively oversize their solar farms so that in winter when the days are shortest, power demand is highest, they are sufficient. Pumped storage solves the day night cycle, not the weather and seasons at the expense of requiring EVEN MORE solar cells to overcome the efficiency loss. And nowhere has reliable wind.

Funny you mention nuclear, because it works amazingly well with pumped storage. Nuclear is the best power source for baseload, but power demand fluctuates during the day and nuclear can't do that well. But if you use excess nuclear at night to pump water up, and use this to cover peaks in demand during the day, you get the dependability of nuclear with the ability to adjust supply with demand.

What you may be missing here is that rivers and lakes have things called catchment areas. When rain lands on the ground, it wants to continue to follow gravity. If the ground is impermeable, it'll roll downhill until it reaches a point where it can't go any further down. If the ground is permeable, the water will seep into the rock and keep going down through that until it hits an impermeable layer of rock. Then, it'll follow that layer of rock down to the lowest point too. Over time, this can form caves as the water erodes the permeable layer its flowing through. If the water reaches a cliff of some kind, where the impermeable layer its following sticks out into the open air, it'll continue to follow gravity, appearing as a spring, and eventually forming a lake if allowed to pool. If the layer of permeable rock is very deep, you can get a huge underground reservoir building up, the top of which is the water table - this is what wells are digging down to reach. Where this water table would rise above the surface of the rock, a lake forms. Here's a [diagram](https://theneutralview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/10-728-How-A-Watershed-Works-1400x681.jpg) of that. Notice that the surface of the river lines up with the water table. 

Of course, this is way more complicated than I can fit into an ELI5, but the idea is there: It's not just the rainwater that drops on the lakes and rivers themselves, but also all the rainwater that falls on the hills and mountainsides that follow the rock layers down to those lakes and rivers.

Higher density population leads to higher risk of desease.

I imagine you also have to be careful what pigs are fed in since they are omnivores rather than herbivores like cows and sheep?

It's pretty interesting

https://tuftsobserver.org/secret-life-of-language-2/

Some quotes:

&gt;Even after some of her memories came back, it took Taylor hours to form answers to simple questions without words to help organize her mind. Any kind of complex thought, including things she used to know, became nearly impossible. She “thought” in images, but had a very difficult time uniting those images into the “sentence” format we use in language. Instead, they floated, disparate and somewhat useless, in her mind, she later recalled.

&gt;“Before my teacher came to me, I did not know that I am,” Keller wrote in her 1908 book The World I Live In. “I lived in a world that was a no-world. I cannot hope to describe adequately that unconscious, yet conscious time of nothingness. I did not know that I knew aught, or that I lived or acted or desired.”

&gt;“Language is an ongoing information processing,” Taylor explained, relating the loss of words to a sudden feeling of connection to the rest of the world. “It’s that constant reminder: I am, this is my name, this is all the data related to me, these are my likes and my dislikes, these are my beliefs, I am an individual… I’m separate from you.”

Basically, my impression is that language is what allows us to keep track of and combine multiple independent thoughts, and to work with abstract thoughts.  Even if we aren't inner-monologuing, we are still using the basic linguistic ability to work with symbols, to recombine them in new ways.

Without language you can still _think_, but it's a more straightforward kind of thinking about concrete interaction with the world, one thing at a time."

While there's not much cause for anyone else to take a bath in ice water even with supervision, there's no harm in putting an ice cube on your skin for a few minutes, which is about as long as you will feel comfortable doing it. The heat loss will be more than offset by your body heat and the ambient air. It will feel cold and wet but it won't do any lasting harm right away.

That's for a single ice cube or a relatively small ice pack that is applied briefly. More ice and/or longer exposure leads to more heat loss and, at some point, that gets to be a real problem for you."

You live in a town with lots of construction accidents. Your population is 50% white 50% black for the sake of this example. Once every week, someone is found pinned under a fallen brick of concreted, pinned, not dead but injured. As the years go by, you realize that even though your town is 50/50 in terms of race, bricks hit white people 10% of the time but black people 90% of the time.

Side A says 'the other side wants you to think that bricks and gravity are racist. we know these are accidents not caused by some crazy racist brick maniac.' they only believe that individual human actions can cause disparate outcomes.

Side B says 'why is there a disparate outcome from a seemingly unbiased event? If these bricks are hitting people in this way, there might be a hidden cause that is negatively affecting black people more than white people'

After an investigation, your town finds that the side of town where most of the black people live had worse construction due to lower income levels and cheaper contracting, whereas the white side of town has less accidents.

In this case, bricks, gravity, and construction aren't racist, but the combination of them in this configuration is causing racially disparate outcomes.


Sometimes people write laws that they know will negatively impact minorities, but they can write it on a way that never refers to race. Sometimes there are laws with purer intentions that still cause disparate outcomes. We have to always be careful that malicious intent and unintended consequences aren't allowed to preserve a society that favors certain race/ethnicity/class/sex/gender/orienting/etc."

The traditional means of drawing frames for your display is by projecting the world onto a 2D grid of pixels. It's quite analogous to the idea of light coming into a camera onto a flat piece of film. Indeed, we often talk about the ""camera"" as your point of view in the game.

With ray tracing, instead of light coming into the camera and landing on a pixel, it's light coming out of the pixel, out of the camera, and shining and reflecting all the way back onto the light source. That's quite literally the computational algorithm - cast a ray, which is just a line through 3D space, until it hits an object in that 3D space, then split and bounce rays from that point of contact outward, again, and again, and again, until all the rays intersect a light source inevitably. Once you do that, you can then sum the light from the source to the effect of every surface it's touched, all the way back to that one pixel. Each surface is going to change the light, make it a little more of one color or another, include light from another source that's also shining on that surface and contributing to that pixel...

Now do that for every pixel on your screen. And do that 60-120x per second. If ray tracing sounds computationally expensive, that's because it is. We try to fake it as much as possible to save our performance budget for other things, but for some effects, there is no substitute."

funmise,1627671393,our22s,"So I read about this thing called the ""automatic generation of gages"". Basically, it's a process of making three flats surfaces by manually rubbing them against each other in pairs. You can't get them truly flat with two pieces cause it causes belling and curvature between the pieces. i.e. one would be concave while the other convex.  What I don't get is why. Because even if all parts receive an equal number of strokes or the cutting powder is equally spread between them, it won't work. So what causes the curvature? 

Maybe I should first ask how grinding works when they are both made of the same material. If one was harder than the other it would just cut away from the softer material. But when they are the same material how does it work? is it that they are not equally hard everywhere or something? And why does it specifically lead to a curvature. 

Apologies if the answer is obvious.",explainlikeimfive,eli5: Why does grinding two objects of the same material (e.g iron) not produce a flat surface?,"'h74beb8', 'h74bthe', 'h74caru', 'h74chz9', 'h74co14', 'h74dj72', 'h74hpdi', 'h74hyij', 'h74jden', 'h74k95c', 'h74kkby', 'h74kwat', 'h74vwpd', 'h74yc0o'",14,"After just two plates are lapped against each other, all you can guarantee is that the two surfaces agree with each other, not that they're flat. They could be, but it's both possible and likely that the surfaces are curved. There's far more ways for there to be some error from a flat plane than there are for them to both be a  flat plane even in the hypothetical case. If you start with two curved surfaces of equal hardness that will wear down at the exact same rate, then unless the curvatures are the exact same you're going to end up with one slightly concave and the other convex. For example if both started convex, but plate A was more convex than plate B, then at some point you'll have worn plate B flat, while plate A remains convex. As you continue to lap them against each other, plate B will end up concave.  

In the real world, the material has inconsistency baked in; one bit might be a bit harder or softer which will more or less guarantee the surfaces can't wear flat. It might still be pretty flat, but when you're trying to make high precision instruments 'pretty good' wont cut it.


Withworth's three plates method gets around this by using a procedure that cancels the errors out. Plate 1 and 2 can meet at a curve or a plane. Same with any other pair. But if any two meet at a curve, one has to be concave and the other convex. Your third plate is then either flat, concave or convex, and wont agree with at least one of the other two. You either have a flat surface compared to a curved surface, or two concave or convex surfaces which curve away from each other. So by grinding them against each other in the right order you can reduce the curvature of each one (concave against concave will flatten both for example) and when you're done you know the only way all three can agree with each other if the surfaces are all planes.  

You can do it with two pieces if you want to break out the engineers blue and have a reference surface you know is flat; by varying pressure you can ensure any curves between the two are worn away till flat, comparing against the reference to make sure you're wearing away the right sections. The cleverness of the three plates method is how it guarantees you a flat surface to high precision from essentially nothing."

The magnet(s) are used in the arm part.  I actually had a disk open on my desk so I took a picture of it.  [The hard drive](https://imgur.com/rNINr68).  In the picture at the bottom left you can see the arm and the magnet under it.  This drive had two magnets, one above and one below, but I removed the top one so you could see the arm.  The arm has a coil of wire on it that has electricity run through it to create a magnetic field, this magnetic field interacts with the field from the magnet to move the arm, much like how an electric motor works, but laid out flat.  The magnet is very powerful (like crush your fingers powerful) so that the arm can be moved very precisely and very quickly to the correct spot on the disk.

This works a bit like a vinyl record player, except that instead of the arm moving from the outside of the disk to the center slowly, reading the whole disk, the arm will jump back and forth across the disk very quickly moving to where the data is."

As an example, look at [this graph](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Statistic/1005000/1009271-blank-355.png) of the population of Russia over time. If you wanted to, you could interpret the population value as pitch and turn it into a sound recording, which would start as a low pitch and then get higher and then level out. It would sound like ""uuuoooaaaeeeiiiieeaaeeeee"".

Does that mean if you listened to the population of Russia it would sound like that? No. It has nothing to do with actual sound all those people make. You can do this with any serial data.

This nicely sidesteps the issue of how your Jupiter situation would cause all that gas to gravitate to Jupiter, increasing its density and eventually turning it into a star."

The key to dissolving the apparent paradox is acceleration. The ship is the one undergoing acceleration, not the Earth. Acceleration acts like gravity (the equivalence principle), and so the accelerating body undergoes the time dilation.

Why? Because acceleration takes you out of your inertial reference frame, which was initially the Earth's rest frame.  Even though you can never see your own clock ticking slower, the fact that you were accelerated out of Earth's frame inexorably ties the time dilation to your clock. 

Once you decelerate back to the Earth's frame your clock *must* be behind the Earth's clock, because Earth remained inertial while you were accelerating.

Your argument of why nobody should be Christian could be extended to any religion as there is no physical proof for any of the big ones. Still, people do. First of religion gives a civilization an evolutionary advantage. Early on people with a moral codex that was enforced by an invisible being and fear did much better than others. So the others without religion got wiped out or taken over. 

Additionally, it provides a lot of comfort. Back then people didn't know a lot about how the world worked and many still do today. Believing that there is a supreme power that watches out for you is comforting and easy. The alternative would be to believe that there is nothing and ultimately you are alone, a scary thought a lot of people don't want to face.

There also wasn't a lot of doubting and societal pressure. A peasant didn't doubt their ruler on what they said. Either because they didn't know better or because it meant punishment. Try going atheist in France in the year 1100, you'd not have a nice life.

In this design, all the weight of the top half is held up by the cable in the middle.

Imagine that top piece falling downward. What would happen to all the cables? The ones around the edges of the tabletop would go slack. That's fine, cables don't mind going slack. But the one in the middle, would have to get longer. Cables hate getting longer, they fight against it with their tensile strength.

So it's that center cable which prevents the top wood piece from moving downwards. What are those other cables doing then? Well, if the center cable were the only one, then that top wood piece could topple over sideways instead of staying upright. Those cables prevent that, because in order for the top piece to topple over sideways, at least one of them would have to get longer too."

Straight-edged weapons are mainly about stabbing. They *can* slash at opponents, but there typically is a pretty small portion of the blade that is good for slashing from a mechanical perspective. Medieval warfare in Europe, particularly with Knights, featured enemies in plate, where slashing was broadly useless, but stabbing at the joints in their armor was actually useful. Ergo, you wanted a straight-edged sword if you didn't have any other sort of armor-piercing weapon.

Curved blades, mechanically, are about slashing, and have a much broader segment of the blade that can be used to slash without causing problems. This is particularly useful from horseback, where you're going to be slashing much more often than stabbing, *and* where you're going to be trying to hack at an opponent from a saddle, where you're going to be bouncing all over the place and moving pretty quickly.

They are not always practical to create given the shape of the land - hills, mountains etc 

They are hard to maintain given you need to keep them free of most vegetation across a large area.

People own land and so you can't just cut firebreaks on a perfect grid across the countryside.

Edit: Because a lot of people are commenting on the numbers I gave for 6-800 feet. I'm referencing one of the numbers given in Wikipedia of a 600 feet wide firebreak which was actually jumped. But it also mentions that embers can fly further and start fires further afield."

Hydrophobic surfaces kind of violate the no-slip condition, which means that drag can be greatly reduced and flow rates can be faster.

For the former I had a physical device where I'd push a button to get a number code, and for the latter I have an app on my phone that gives me a code. I can *maybe* see the phone one being different since the phone has internet so it could inform the game account what code is being displayed, but the physical device really confused me.

It's not connected to any sort of network. When I set it up I put in a serial number that was on the device to ""link"" it to my game account. But if the number is randomly generated how does my game know what code it generated? I thought maybe it was a sequence thing, like Code A has been used, so now it'll ask for Code B next time, then Code C... but I know this isn't the case as I've accidentally hit the physical button to display a code without then entering it into the game. It just always seems to work.

So then I thought maybe each serial number is linked to specific codes and all the codes associated with that device were acceptable. But over years of playing I can't recall ever starting to recognize codes.

The idle process is where the CPU spends its time when it has nothing else to do. Back in the DOS days this was just a busy loop. These days the CPU goes into a low-power sleep state until it needs to switch processes again.

This sends a signal to one of 26 inputs on a dial which then sends it to one of the 26 outputs. The relationship between the position of the inputs and outputs is random. The output of this dial connects to the input of a second dial which scrambles the position again. This then goes to a third dial and repeat. Lastly, the signal goes to a switch board that has a port for every letter of the alphabet. For 10 of these letters, there is a plug connecting them. So if a plug connects ""A"" and ""T"", and the output from the dials would lead to ""A"", then the plug board changes it to ""T"" (and vice versa).

Basically, by pressing a letter on this typewriter, the machine changes it into a different letter through a complex and convoluted process. Even though this process is strictly deterministic, it is so complex that it is difficult to reverse engineer it (to be given an output letter and figure out what the input letter would be). Also, the physical act of pressing a key causes the dials to turn which rearranges how the letters are scrambled. So if you pressed the same letter twice, it would result in two different outputs, with the mathematical relationship between them heavily obfuscated.

Despite that complexity, if you knew the settings of the machine (the specific three dials used, their initial settings, and the plug board settings), you can decipher and replicate any message. Military personnel would have code books which would have that days settings. These initial settings would be used to securely sending new settings for each individual message.

This was hard to break because between all of the possibilities, there were just too many settings to try and brute force a solution. By the time you could do that, the message you decrypted would be obsolete."

Secondly, excessive drinking can affect the liver by making it fatty. The liver prioritizes breaking down alcohol over breaking down fat.

This is, more or less, the pattern of signals that you need to send to the CPU to get it to perform tasks. Traditional Intel chips run on something called the x86 instruction set, while ARM chips run on their own instruction set.

So in order to have one code work on the other, you would have to know all the bit patterns for one, decode them, and then re-encode them for the new pattern.

Except it's still not that simple. Not every instruction has a 1:1 translation with the other language. So you have to be able to interpret instructions that exist in one language, and then make a pattern for them in the other.

Except it's still not that simple. Each instruction has more than one effective output. You get the actual output of your instruction, but then there are also things called Flags. These are specialized circuit that provide very quick access to important pieces of data from the previous instruction. One example for x86 is the Zero flag, which is just set if the result of the last instruction is zero. That can be quickly used as an input for other instructions to do some conditional operation, requiring only one bit to be checked rather than 64 bits from the actual output. 

Rosetta handles all of this (or as much as possible). It takes a program that was compiled for x86 and tries to translate it into Apple's new ARM instruction set. This allows applications built for the old Intel line of Macs to still work on the new ARM line without needing to be immediately rebuilt."

However, you'd have to keep in mind that Walmart will sell your customers a whole case of water for a few dollars, so you'd have to price it comparatively enough so that it isn't worth the extra effort to pass you up and go to Walmart.

If you sold those same waters inside at a concert venue with no re-entry, you wouldn't be competing with outside prices and could essentially charge whatever you want for them.

During a natural disaster like a hurricane, those waters become EXTREMELY VALUABLE.  Because everyone wants to buy and hoard water.  Allowing prices to swell during disasters sounds awful, but it's actually a very humane way to deal with hoarding.

You start with a road - a vehicle passageway that connects two points as a basis.

A street is a road that you plan on putting buildings onto both sides.  Many cities are laid out with parallel streets that you need to connect up along their lengths, so you call those connecting roads ""avenues"". Got a long island in the middle of a wide road? That's a boulevard. And if your residential neighborhood has a short street with a loop at the end, that can be a ""court""; no loop means it's a ""place"" instead; if both ends of your road hook onto the same street in a ""C"" shape, you have a crescent. And to get to a different neighborhood or visit a friend out in the country who lives on a narrow ""lane"", you have to drive an often-scenic 'drive' to get there.

There's a ton of variability because roads can change over time. Residential areas can expand and require changes to traffic patterns or larger access roads to reach the highway, so what used to be a drive is now a boulevard, but they don't rename it."

during the credit crisis of 2008 many banks had put their money in COD. which were a a package of loans. some of these loans where with ppl who could't or would't pay them back. As this came to light the value of those COD lowered. This meant that ppl realized that banks no longer had enough money to cover their savingsaccounts. (im skipping a few steps here). this resulted in a housingmarket crash. Because many of the loans were covered by the value of the house and the house was suddenly worth less, many ppl decided to not pay back their loan, which made the problem worse.

the answer is threefold:

Some banks where so heavy damaged they could not be saved, they went bankrupt or were nationalized.

1. if your savings were in such a bank and the bank was not ""insured"" by the government to pay back savingsaccounts ( up to 100k€). you were out of luck. your money was in fact gone. There was an Icelandic bank which was in this scenario.

2. if your savingsaccount was insured by the government, you would have received your savings up to 100k. i don't think this happened.

You drop them all on this grate and some of them will fall through while others will not. You gather all of those that didn't fall through up and drop them again, repeating this process many times.

When you are done what do the objects you have left all have in common? Obviously it is that they are very unlikely to fall through that storm drain grate! This is the basic idea at work with all life.

Organisms live and reproduce because that is what got them to be around today. If they didn't reproduce they would be like the stuff that fell through the grate, they wouldn't exist anymore. Living is a prerequisite to reproducing, corpses don't make babies, so living creatures around today tend towards staying alive long enough to reproduce.

They don't **want** to stay alive exactly, they stay alive because of what they are, because of their fundamental structure. If you can't get air you struggle to breathe not because you make a reasoned, logical thought process from the necessity of breathing to maintaining biological functions to your intended life goals. You struggle to breathe because of an evolved biochemical pathway linking the buildup of carbon dioxide in your blood to a reflexive urge to breathe. Creatures that didn't have that strong reflex tended to asphyxiate and became less common as time went by, so all we have left are those that do have the reflex.

So to answer your question plants don't need emotions or goals to do things that maintain their lives, just like objects don't need to desire features that keep them from falling down that storm drain grate. It is just what they are because they have been sorted for those features."

Those particles moving through your body (specifically the heart) is what kills you.

Voltage (V) is the amount of force trying to move those particles. This is determined by the source of the electrical power (e.g. a *9-Volt* battery).

There’s a fundamental relationship between current (I) and voltage (V): Ohm’s law.

&gt; V = I * R

The “R” is resistance, or impedance, which represents how hard it is to move charged particles through something. Ohm’s law says that objects with high resistance (i.e. poor conductors) require more force to move charge particles through them. So the same force (voltage) can move fewer charged particles (current) through a poor conductor (high resistance) than through a good conductor (low resistance).

Your body, and specifically your skin, has very high resistance (when dry). This means that, for a given voltage, current will be fairly low and thus not able to cause major harm. However, if you change the resistance all of a sudden by, say, accidentally cutting your skin or getting it wet, now that same voltage will generate a much larger current that can kill you.

As an aside, there is such a thing as a *microshock*, which is when a tiny amount of current passes directly through the heart and disrupts it’s function. This can pretty much only happen during some kind of surgery where the heart muscles are directly exposed to a source of electricity."

But the mechanism to automate the swiping is far too expensive to have hundreds of them installed at once.

The actual problem with the scheme is the people suck. Some people think going slower or faster is the key, but there's a just right speed in the middle.

And that range of just right speeds is incredibly wide.

The two things that ruin a card swipe are twisting the card at all and inconsistent swipe speed.

The magnetic stripe is red by comparing magnetic field changes over time. If you are causing the head to be lifted from the card by twisting the card at all, or if you stutter your way through the reader with going faster and slower at different times, then it looks like a different number than what's written on the card.

It's the mechanical equivalent of smudging a barcode and then wondering why the barcode reader can't read the gray smudge.

And note that If the operator at the front desk who is writing the card number has an uneven hand they might have a bad track record of successfully writing a proper numbers on the card. The technology is designed to be used casually. Any attempt to use it deliberately, lacking the appropriate elan, can mess up the read or the write of operation.

Additionally, the system will be down while the data is being restored, which depending on size, can take a long, long time, resulting in work slowdowns, or systems being offline and unable to record new data.
  
Ctrl-z only works on modern applications because there’s a running change log held resident in memory that can be rolled back.

FangTheHedgebat,1627410570,osse9s,"I saw the Texas fireball this past Sunday, and while they're saying now it probably wasn't from the Perseids meteor shower, I still did enough research to know about the Swift Tuttle comet that causes the Perseids but something confuses me. 

Supposedly, the Swift Tuttle comet orbits the sun every 133 years. But the Perseids meteor shower happens every Augustish. With a path so long (or maybe it's just slow) wouldn't the comet eventually get so far away from us that we won't see it for a long time? How do we cross paths with it yearly if it takes that long to orbit the sun?

Does this mean the Perseids shower is ""temporary"" or ""seasonal"" (as in, it'll be yearly for a few years while it's close before it gets too far) or is that not how it works? Because if it's truly truly annual, then I'm confused. The paths and maths in my head just don't seem to line up. Can someone please explain?

TLDR: How can the Perseids show up every year if it takes the comet so long to orbit the sun? Won't it get too far away at some point?",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How are the Perseid meteor showers recurring if it takes the Swift-Tuttle comet that causes them 133 years to orbit the sun?,"'h6qjbap', 'h6qjx3j', 'h6qo0it', 'h6sr3az', 'h6sri6j', 'h6t6j0l', 'h6t7vcb'",7,"&gt;That is a field of rocks floating around in space.  
&gt;  
&gt;Once a year, the earth passes through that little field of rocks.

You cant have a field of rock stationary in one location of earth orbit around the sun, it will fall into the sun because if its gravity.

A better explanation is that is stuff that was ejected from Swift–Tuttle when it orbits the sun. The comet tail is stuff that blows off when the comet is heated by the sun.    The blow-off stuff will almost follow the same path as the comet.

So a bit like if you drive a truck with sand and some of it is blown off by the wind and you get a trail of it behind you. For orbit getting blown off does not mean it stops but that it moves at a slightly different speed so it spreads out but still obit the sun. 

So what we collide with is a small particle with quite similar orbit to Swift–Tuttle but is not in the same location in the orbit."

Games run at very fast speeds, often times more than 60 frames per second. That means, the GPU has less than 16.66ms to render one frame at 1920x1080 resolution, or the game will start to dip below 60 FPS.

Now, have you heard the commonly circulated internet fact that a single frame of Frozen took a week to render? So how do we do that, but in 16ms? The answer is that engineers created ""hacky"" ways to render your game that are in no way physically accurate, but will produce okay-ish results really quickly.

One of the most difficult things to simulate with these ""fake"" methods are reflections. Because well, reflections are inherently a byproduct of realism. Light bouncing around multiple times makes things reflect off each other. We certainly cannot afford to do that kind of processing, otherwise it would take longer to render the frame, and we don't want to play games with the FPS of a slide show.

But the engineers are smart, so they created special methods to once again ""fake"" the reflections. For example, [cube maps](https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced/cubemaps_skybox.png)! These work by pre-rendering beforehand the reflection of the world around the object, and then drawing a texture based on that rendering. So, when you play the game, it's simply just drawing a texture, not rendering multiple bouncing light rays. The downside of this method is that it does not allow dynamic reflections, because the textures are already pre-rendered beforehand and cannot change.

With ray tracing, like the name implies, games are able to draw light rays (simulating light bouncing) more realistically, and hence draw real time reflections and such, but without much more effort. This can be done with the help of the novel RT cores that Nvidia developed in their 2xxx and 3xxx cards."

They never give any specifics of what parts of the story were true or how different the real event was from the reenactment, so no one can ever actually call bs. I get this, it's entertainment.

In simple words, all the files of the software are present on the computer, so why can't the source-code of it be *extracted* in some way?

If that is not possible, then how come crackers/patchers *crack* a software to function without a license? (Because I reckon they would need access to the code in order to modify its functioning.)

You can't just rename a source code file to an .exe and expect it to run the same way you can't expect to bite into a recipe and have it taste like bread. It has to be compiled first.

And after it's been compiled, trying to extract the code from a compiled program is like trying to extract individual ingredients from a loaf of bread. The compilation process transforms the human-readable code into a usable form, just like the baking process transforms the ingredients into an edible form.

Edit: And while I don't entirely know how cracking works, they don't have to reverse-engineer the entire program; just the protection mechanism. Think of it like picking a lock, as opposed to rebuilding an entire house."

What can help is to pump air into the water. This 1) breaks surface tension, 2) replaces some of the heavy water with light air, lowering the average density and thus force required to push it out of the way.

It allows the computer to store and access information quickly.  Big programs require quick access to lots of information, so you need more RAM.  

RAM usually comes as small removable circuit boards that fit into the main circuit board of your computer.  These are called ""RAM sticks"".  Desktops often have space for 4 RAM sticks, while laptops usually only have room for two.  Some laptops don't use RAM sticks but have the RAM permanently attached to the main circuit board.  The advantage of having removable RAM is that you can remove the sticks and upgrade it after purchase.  

When looking at computer specs, they will always tell you the total amount of RAM (say 12GB).  Sometimes they will also tell you the size of each stick of RAM, for instance 1x 8GB stick and 1x 4GB stick.  

There are all sorts of fiddly details about RAM, but for a beginner I really wouldn't worry about much except the total amount they include.  Most higher end games these days will be expecting 16GB of RAM.

Water takes time to get purified, whether through the Earth or through modern water treatment systems. The more **clean** water you waste, the more water is caught up in the purification cycle, which means people can't use that water now.

Crops are grown through water, soil, and sunlight, but only if the conditions are correct for the plants. You can't grow rice in the desert or the arctic, no matter how much water you provide. So the supply of good soil in the proper climate is limited. Since that is limited, the rate at which food can be produced is limited.

Coal and oil took many thousands to millions of years to produce, in conditions that are no longer possible. Coal was created when the world's first trees died. There was no bacteria capable of breaking the wood down, so it just sat there and slowly got buried. Over time, the heat and pressure baked the wood into coal. Nowadays, wood will pretty easily decay, so coal can never be made that way again. Oil was made in a similar fashion, except in oceans from sealife.

In general, the concern isn't about running out of things (except for oil, coal, natural gas) as much as it is consuming things faster than we can make them. We can spend money and resources to increase this rate, but that means more resources taken from other projects/purposes, which means something else loses out."

Next you need to calibrate it. Use a zinc copper battery, batteries have voltages dependent on their design. Zinc, copper, paper, and vinegar makes a 1.1V battery. You can stack the cells to make a bigger battery. Do it for 1 through 10 cells, and measure with your voltmeter and on your ammeter scale mark these readings as 1.1V, 2.2V, ... 11V

Then looking at it, just mark off the even voltages, it should be fairly obvious. Now you have a calibrated voltmeter. Only part I had to look up was the voltage of a zinc-copper battery."

They exist to maintain water pressure.  Why?  Because gravity doesn't cost anything.

Think of a water tower as a bathtub.

You fill the water up to the brim and then you open the drain.  Once you do this, the pipe connected to the drain is at 100% pressure.  Meaning the water in the tub is keeping the pipe completely pressurized....and it will stay that way until the tub is empty.

The water tower works the same way except the drain is always open.

When the water level gets low, the pump kicks on and it fills the water tower up faster than it's being drained out.  That way, gravity keeps the pipes pressurized.  That's why towers are up high instead of on the ground.  The extra height makes sure the reservoir is always up higher than any of the pipes in the area...thus maintaining pressure.

It's simple energy conservation.  

It costs municipalities far less to run a pump every so often to feed a water tower...than it would to run a pump 24/7/365 to keep the pipes fully pressurized"

We also do not see in ""frames"" - that is, we don't see a series of still images in rapid succession that looks like a continuous ""video"".

Each of our retinal ganglion cells (our ""seeing"" cells) is connected to our brain. When it is exposed to a change in light (very oversimplified for ELI5), these seeing cells send a signal to our brain. This happens all the time in all of our seeing cells, even when our eyes are closed, and there are millions and millions of these cells, each firing (mostly) on their own. 

Our brain receives all of this continuously and extracts details, like edges and shapes, and then assembles these into a ""mental image"" that we experience as vision. It's actually one of the best understood systems in the brain, and has been studied for over a century. This happens continuously, and we experience it as a continual ""stream of vision"", where-as a video quickly take pictures over and over again and then plays them back to create the illusion of continuity.

So you can see why we can't quite say, ""humans see in XX Hz"". The way our eyes work to create vision is fundamentally different from how cameras work to create videos.

EDIT: I found a [scientific article](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep07861) that claims human subjects could detect a single altered frame in 500 FPS video. This doesn't mean we ""see"" in 500 FPS; instead it means our sight cells and brain are sensitive enough to catch a frame that was visible for only 0.02 seconds. It's like how you can run your finger along a piece of wood and find a tiny spot that's rough through touch alone; our brain looks for patterns in the visual information coming from our eyes, and if that pattern is broken our brain is very good at detecting it and making us aware of it."

A lot of good advice so far, one thing I'll add is that you need to pay attention to bus numbers. If you're waiting at a stop, chances are that several buses will stop there. Not every one will go to the same place. And if there's a letter, that's important too. If you need the 18 bus, the 18A will probably not get you there.

Also pay attention to which direction the bus goes. Most bus routes are circular, and they will turn around and head the opposite direction. Usually you can apply common sense. If you're on an east-west road and need to go west, there will usually be two bus stops on either side of the road. Be on the side of the road that is heading west. Sometimes it's more complicated, but if you look at the route map for your bus, it's usually easy to tell.

Also, often Google Maps or other services will help you out here. When you look up directions, one of them will be for public transit, complete with bus numbers and scheduled times. This will also depend on how reliable your transit system is. But at the very least will keep you from having to pour over maps yourself.

Good luck!"

Taking a step back: When you take out a mortgage the bank doesn’t hold onto it. It’s not like in “it’s a wonderful life” where the Savings and Loan (btw - that’s another financial crisis to look up!) holds onto the mortgage and using incoming revenue to write new mortgages. Instead they bank promptly sells it to a bigger bank - if you ever take out a mortgage you’ll get a letter about 6-8 weeks later telling you it’s now owned by a different company, with instructions on any changes to where you send your payments. Your bank gets all their profits from the loan immediately and now has $$$ on hand to issue another loan. So their incentive is to write as many loans as possible.

The bigger bank might then sell a giant package of loans to an even bigger bank, and so on. Same deal. Eventually you run out of big enough banks. So in the late 90’s to early 00’s the financial sector came up with “mortgage backed securities” - giant packages of loans that they sold to pension funds (the biggest banks on the planet) or to the stock market. This kept money coming in to the bigger banks to keep buying loans from the smaller banks so they could keep writing new loans.

/ this is long, bear with me.

These offered really good returns for the risk profile so it was easy to sell them.

Problem was - they were lying about the risks. Along the way all these super high risk loans that should never have been written were being packaged up with ultra safe loans so the whole package got a really good risk rating. Then they’d slice and dice the packages again to put more and more high risk loans in - gaming the system to get AAA ratings for products that should have been C/D rated. The super high ratings meant that things like pension funds were under a lot of pressure to buy them because the risk profile pensions operate under means a significant portion of the fund has to go to the very highest rated assets and aside from Treasury Bonds almost nothing comes close to AAA, and treasury bonds give a really bad return on investment- which they can get away with because they’re a safe asset.

They were able to keep this up for a while because the house market was constantly rising so any loans that defaulted were easily sold for more than the loan value and everyone who was owed money got paid.

Then it got to the point that so many loans were defaulting that they couldn’t keep it hidden anymore and cracks started to show. House prices stalled out, and started falling. Now there wasn’t enough money from the sales to pay everyone so all these giant financial funds started to look closely at what they’d been sold and realized they were sitting on garbage loans that were going to default.

So they stopped buying loans.

So the big banks stopped getting money to buy loans from smaller banks.

So the smaller banks stopped getting money to write new loans.

So the access to credit to fuel the housing market boom vanished.

So house prices fell.

This meant anyone who’d bought a house and defaulted was basically out their life savings because their deposit was nuked. So they stopped spending money in the rest of the economy.

It also meant all these giant financial institutions at the top didn’t have any money to write loans for other types of business venture, which tanked a large portion of the economy. This resulted in even more people losing their jobs and having to sell their homes, which tanked the housing market further, and wiped out a huge portion of their life savings. This cycled a few times for about a year hitting various sectors of the economy and putting loads of people out of work and caused a lot of loan defaults so a lot of people lost their homes.

Looping back to the initial question you have on defaulting - one thing that helped fuel all this were “ARM” mortgages - these offer a short term at a very low interest rate and then the rates increase substantially. These were used to write mortgages to people who should never have been given loans - the low initial payments allowed them to be able to service the loan for a few years, but they would never be able to make payments once the rates started adjusting - but when the banks stopped writing loans as easily these people couldn’t refinance so were fucked and lost their homes.

There were other similar high risk products going on too - loans that were interest only for a few years, so the borrowers weren’t even clearing their loan balance, loans with “balloon payments” where large lump sums are due in certain years to enable overall lower interest rates, and a lot of “refinance” loans given to people who were facing financial difficulties so tapped into their home equity- borrowing against an inflated home value. All these groups ended up in a lot of trouble."

Coma is not a specific thing, as one commenter stated it’s a prolonged period of unconsciousness.  The ones we hear about in fiction, the “I got hit by a truck and was out for weeks months years then woke up”… I’ve never ever seen that.  It’s not utterly unheard of but sooo rare.

Big caveat: I’m writing this as an eli5.  This is a topic we could talk about for months and never get to the bottom of.  I’m going to generalize and simplify and use analogies that break down at certain levels, but it’s a decent basic “what is this”.

Generally two big categories as I see think of them:

Medically induced.  Usually when you need to be on a ventilator, or pain just cannot be controlled to the point that the person is in sever distress, that type of stuff.  We use sedation to keep them out.  Then regularly withdraw sedation when we think they might be able to handle breathing again, turn the assist off on the vent, and if they can pull their own breaths and meet a few other criteria boom.  Tube out.

Trauma induced.  This doesn’t have to be mechanical trauma, it can be hypoxia say from a hanging suicide attempt, chemical trauma, etc.  The brain is damaged and inflamed and not working right.  So we support them, and do some scans to see if we can determine obvious permanent damage.  If it’s a gray area we in consultation with the family wait and see until the situation declares itself.  The vast majority of the time there is sever brain damage and the patient does not have a good outcome, it’s really a matter of how much damage is done and if there is enough left to support a quality of life that person would find acceptable.

Being in a coma is incredibly damaging on its own even if you recover from the initial insult.  The drugs we use for sedation produce HIGE problems - most folks have severe ptsd from hallucinations and dreams coming in abs out as we are doing horrible things with needles and tubes and restraints.  The muscle wasting is incredible - if you are on a vent for 2 weeks, you have a 1 in 8 chance of being strong enough to do your own dishes after a whole year of rehab.  It’s awful.  The diaphragm starts atrophying as soon as the vent comes on, and so their breathing is very weak.  

We provide nutrition either through the iv (usually last choice) or through a stomach tube.  Waste is elongated through tubes in the urethra and rectum.  We do the best we can with constant position changes to avoid bed sores, but the human body isn’t meant to be laying down for long periods and after a time the best efforts fail.  You have a lot of I’ve and lines going in, so infections are a constant battle.  You are in an icu where the sickest ppl on earth are, so you are exposed to all the worst bugs - and even the best infection control procedures pale when matched against bacteria.  They are very very good at what they do."

Those two things are completely different in how they operate.

A lot of what you hear about government debt in the media is usually just scare tactics to equate government finances to person debt as a means to get public opinion onside to curb spending, which usually means justifying slashing programs.

A Government literally has the ability to print money, so worst case scenario a government can print cash to pay it's debts. That wouldn't be ideal because it could lead to rampant inflation, but it can do that.

The debt ceiling is an artificial construct put in by the government as a symbolic means to curb government spending. It's a piece of legislation not a hard line, so it can raised or removed if required.

Also the US government is not in as much debt as people think. Trillions of Dollars is a lot of money, don't get me wrong. But if you compare the governments income to it's debt it's comparable to a person having a large but still reasonable mortgage.

**The US government is constitutionally required to pay its debts**, that's part of why the credit rating for the US is so good. The US Congress couldn't choose to default on the debt if it wanted to. Plus those in power understand the economic turmoil that would occur should the US default on debt, so they won't let that happen.

Should the US government continue to borrow money on mass to operate? well that's a matter of opinion.

Generally speaking no, there should be an effort towards paying down the national debt but eliminating it completely would be asinine. The entire savings and loans industry is propped up on Government Bonds and government debt is a critical part to how people save money for retirement.

Also government debt is closer to Corporate debt than personal debt in function and form. Most top Corporations are in as much debt comparatively to the US government and that's considered responsible.

In crisis times like the pandemic one leading economic theory says 'yes' the government should borrow money in order to help keep the economy going. That keeps people employed and helps the economy rebound more quickly.

Another economic theory known as austerity says the government should curb spending during a crisis to keep money in the pockets of people and corporations. However this has been effectively debunked as an effective theory as it only serves to make the economic situation worse.

To save money on government spending the real answer is to stop borrowing Trillions to fight wars. The War on Terror is the single largest cause of increased government debt in the past 2 decades."

HAHGoTtEm_BDNjr,1627276255,ors0g1,"What law makes it “legal to steal” as they allege

All I’ve found in terms of actual law is that anything over 950 is a felony. Literally all I’ve been able to find because when I look up “California theft law” all I get is a billion New York posts that say things like “everyone steals in San Francisco cause it’s practically legal, watch this video of a theft at Walgreens where it’s their policy to not attempt to stop thieves nationwide.

You're correct.  Anything greater than $950 is a felony, anything below $50 can be charged as a minor infractions and anything between is a misdemeanor. 

Where these people may be confused is that *Walgreens doesn't have to enforce these laws*.  It is not, repeat **NOT**, Walgreen's place or right to enforce laws covering larceny.  That is what the police are for, that is literally their primary function - enforce the law.  Walgreen's cannot arrest a person for shoplifting.  Now there is a bit of gray area because they do have a right to defend their property, so if they caught someone they COULD detain the person until the Police arrive but that's the point.  The Police HAVE to get involved. 

Thus it becomes a business decision.  Walgreens is a multi-billion dollar company.  Someone stealing $50 of random crap from one store is such a small number that they probably accidentally lose that money in spare change under the seats of the CEO's private jet.  It would not at all be unusual for Walgreens to say ""if you see someone shoplifting note down their description and call the cops but otherwise do NOT engage with them"" because they'd rather lose the goods than have an employee hurt or even killed trying to be a hero.  

You know who else has this policy - Banks.  Any bank in the US you can walk in and say ""this is a robbery"" and there is a good chance they'll open up the cash drawer and let you walk out with it.  Of course a few minutes later the Police and/or FBI will come to kick your head in but that's not the Bank's problem.  They have insurance and would much prefer dealing with that than an employee or customer hurt or killed."

You're probably familiar with the name *Albert Einstein* from his famous equation E=mc^2.  If you're particularly geeky, ""Hey, Einstein, I'm on your side!""

Something else he's known for is the theory of *relativity* (two of them, actually) which say that a lot of things are *relative to* other things -- that is, they can't be objectively measured. Specifically, we're interested in the components of both theories that talk about time.

The theory of *special relativity* says that a moving clock ticks slower than a stationary clock. That is, a clock that's moving very fast will measure time slower ***relative to*** a clock that's not moving. It won't see its own seconds passing any slower, but it will see a stationary clock's seconds passing *faster.*

The other theory, about *general* relativity, says that a clock deeper in a gravity well ticks slower than one farther away. Conversely, a clock further away ticks faster.

Put these two together, and someone living on a space station actually experiences the flow of time very slightly differently: after spending six months aboard the ISS, Einstein's theories predict that an astronaut would age about 0.005 seconds *less* than us schlubs on Earth."

In general only sequences that are client side are susceptible to cheats or hacks, you change the code stored on your machine to do something different to what's intended.

These kinds of cheats are generally detected by a watchdog style routine at serverside.  It looks for normally impossible situations.  This catches things like fly-hacking, no-clipping and speed hacks.

Things like an aim-bot are much harder, that's sitting in client-side code, so the server only sees the result; where your client says you are aiming.  These are harder to detect, scripts look for things like 'snapping', movements that would require superhuman accuracy and consistency.

I don't really know warzone, but I do know WoW.  The server is constantly checking values, so you can't fiddle with life or damage numbers, you could maybe mess with your absolute position a bit, but the server knows where you were a moment ago and how fast it is possible to move.  As I aluded to above, aim-bot is hard to detect (via machine, a human spots it fairly easy, but teaching a script to do so is non-trivial).  Godmode would be very easy to detect on the other hand.  The first time the server says you are hit but your health does not fall, you are busted.  Classic games that do have godmodes, such as Doom, had them coded in by the developers.

Although our ancestors didn't understand the underlying mechanisms for why food spoiled (bacteria and molds) they did understand that drying, aging, and storing food in toxic environments (acids and alcohol) would preserve food.

We actually still eat a lot of preserved food today, but you just take it for granted. Most people don't think about it as preserved food likely because you buy it at the supermarket instead of spending the time and effort to preserve it on the farm.

Going back as far as the Victorian age Ice was commercially harvested and delivered to peoples homes. The term icebox for the Fridge came from a time when people bought large blocks of literal ice to keep food preserved and cold. Ice was harvested from Lakes and Rivers (and even the Arctic) during the winter months and stored in warehouses covered in insulation like straw. With enough straw covered ice in a confined space it would last all summer.

But the idea of freezing food to preserve it goes back a lot farther than that with Stone Age tribes burying food, particularly meat, in snow banks to keep it from rotting.

But there are plenty of other ways to preserve food.

Canning food is traced back to Napoleon who was the first to take advantage of the technique to help feed his armies march across Europe. Originally they used Champagne bottles and later switched to cans sealed with lead (which had obvious downsides they didn't know about it). But Pasteurization of canned goods and Milk didn't become common place until the 19th century so there was a lot of spoilage. (People knew about the benefits of heating food to preserve it for centuries, but they didn't know why. The nature of Bacterial organisms wasn't discovered until the 19th century)

Root vegetables like Potatoes, Turnips, and Carrots keep a long time by themselves and homes would often have cellars where food could be kept cold and dry.

Cheese is a preserved Milk product and is shelf stable. Humans have eaten cheese since before we developed the gut bacteria needed to digest pure milk.

Grains like Wheat, Corn, Oats, and Rice could be dried and ground into dry powder. Flour for example is a dried preserved wheat, while commercial rice is dried to keep it shelf stable. Oatmeal is made from dried Oats and was a staple food/starch in the Navy for a long time. Pasta is also a preserved grain.

Food like bread had to be made daily because it didn't last, while the flour, salt, and lard used in making it did. To make bread last you had to bake it until it was completely dry to be shelf stable. These biscuits made the basis of naval rations known as Hardtack.

Fermented foods like beer, wine, and Kimchi are kept preserved by the alcohol content that wards off bacteria. Sailors were once given a ration of Rum because along with Lime or Lemon juice it was a reliable way to get Vitamin C, plus it was good for morale.

Sausages like Pepperoni, hot dogs, farmer sausage, bologna, etc are preserved meat mixed with fat and spices and store in a tube (traditionally animal intestine) and then smoked to dry it out and preserve it. Similar techniques are used to preserve deli meat, which is shelf stable until sliced.

Smoked fish, and meat was also common. Bacon for example is a preserved meat product as well.

While salt was also frequently used to preserve meat, again to get the moisture out of the meat to prevent bacteria from growing. Common examples being Salt pork, or salt fish.

There was also potted meat, where meat was ground, cooked, and stored in clay or glass jars sealed with animal fat.

Pickling is another common preservation technique. Vinegar occurs as a natural bi-product of making alcohol and storing things like beets, onions, peppers, and cucumbers in vinegar helps keep them around a long time. Hence why they are still referred to as 'preserves'. During the winter months people would eat pickled vegetables because that's what you could eat to get your vitamins out of season.

Similarly Jams are preserved fruit.

When you talk about leftovers, people had to get clever. Soup for example was almost always made from garbage, the leftover bones of animals used to make stock and mixed with cutup vegetables and dried grains or pasta.

There are people who work for their money like doctors, or small business owners who still work daily in their stores / restaurants. This is not who is being referred to when people say tax the rich. The rich they are referring to are not what we would call the working rich. You can work hard and with a healthy dose of luck earn a millions dollars over the course of a couple years.  But you can only steal a billion dollars from the work of thousands and thousands of other people most of whom are paid so little they struggle to live. 

Let's take this one step further and just do a logic experiment about who is better for the economy as well. If one person has a billion dollars How many pairs of jeans do they buy? How many times a week do they eat out at a local restaurant? Now if you spread a billion dollars out over 100 million people, how many more times has a local restaurant had a patron? How many more items have been purchased in stores and online? One person hoarding their stolen billion dollars is not really good for the economy while a 100 million people all spending a bit of extra money this week is amazing for our local industries.

Let's also not forget that the tax rate used to be over 90% for the truly rich. And that a graduated tax system means you only pay money over a certain threshold, so you are not hurting what's most people would refer to as the working rich. 

And finally, the actual rich don't currently pay taxes. My wife and I who are financially on the low end of middle income paid more taxes than Jeff bezos and Elon musk put together last year. So I'm not even arguing we should massively tax the rich, but they aren't even paying their fair share as a percentage of their hoarded wealth. 

And before someone starts saying yes but they don't have access to that capital, you misunderstand how stocks work. Stock prices go up by predatory business practices and paying workers as little as possible thereby increasing your net worth. Stock can also be given away as both bonuses and part of compensation to workers within a company. There are many ways that the disgusting wealth of the rich can be paid to the workers actually making those companies function."

The reason most of our information processing works using electromagnetism is because when you get down to it, we don't really have many choices. There are only four fundamental forces in the universe, one of them being electromagnetism, and the other three being the strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity. The strong and weak nuclear forces act inside the nucleus of atoms. That's pretty hard for things on the molecular scale (like life) to manipulate. Gravity works on a way too large scale to be useful for information processing by life, although humans could theoretically create gravity-based information processors (Steve Mould has a video of a basic calculator that runs on the flow of water).

The only bit of the universe left then is electromagnetism, so every practical information processing procedure is going to end up based on some property of electromagnetism, because electromagnetism is the fundamental force that's most interactive  on the molecular level (the level of life and circuits)."

However, most electric cars are designed not to work this way; the electric motor kicks in at lower speeds when the gas engine is putting out much less than 200 HP.  When you floor the car, the electric motor turns off and your maximum horsepower is probably closer to 200 HP of the gas engine.  

Only some very expensive hybrid supercars such as the McLaren P1 actually have the gas and electric motors running at the same time at maximum power level, using the electric motor sort of like a turbocharger.  

Another thing to consider is that engines and motors put out different power levels at different rotational speeds.  Electric motors tend to put out their maximum power at low speed, while gasoline engines tend to put out their maximum power at high speed.  Because the motor and engine are connected to the same set of wheels, there is never a time when both the motor and engine are at their peak power at the same time."

Eukarya have cells with nuclei and organelles.

There has been some debate over terms over the last 50 years or so, because the traditional kingdoms clash with more modern understanding of DNA and ancestry.  In the early years of taxonomy, things were somewhat arbitrarily grouped together by what characteristics seemed more important to scientists, but now that we can analyze DNA and RNA, we can trace genetic similarities and probable shared ancestry very well, and there has been a movement to group organisms into clades, which are groups that include an ancestor and all of its descendants. This has its pros and cons, and I personally believe in a mix of the traditional and cladist classification. Kingdoms are part of this debate as it’s been found that the traditional model grouped a lot of things with different ancestors together, such as bacteria, archaea and some single celled eukaryotes into a single kingdom or bacteria with the ability to photosynthesize into the plant kingdom. Domains and the further divisions of Kingdoms is an attempt to make Kingdoms clades, and differences between countries are due to what caught on. The most recently proposed model has 7 Kingdoms."

Green is the one they don’t keep largely because this energy collecting process (photosynthesis) is done by chlorophyll (a part inside the cells). Chlorophyll does not absorb green light. This selection of not absorbing green is also somewhat strategic as it isn’t the highest energy wavelength of light.

A horse pulling with 180 lbf against a wheel of 12 ft diameter 144 times an hour gave a result of 32,572 ft-lbf/min, which was then rounded to 33,000 ft-lbf/min, or 550 ft-lbf/sec. When metric rolled around, it was defined as the power needed to lift a 75 kg weight by 1 meter over 1 second, which came out to about 735 watts.

Since cars also output mechanical power, it was logical to use the same units to compare them, leading to car engines being measure by horsepower by tradition.

It has the same units as watts, so you could define anything with watts instead. But, again, just by tradition, people use horsepower."

Two common misconceptions out of the way first: insurance is not 1. a gamble, 2. an investment.    

  
Once you make a contribution to an insurance that money is gone. It's no longer yours. Why? Because you just paid for a service with that money. You receive that service immediately and it usually boils down to some form of ""**immunity from bankruptcy due to X**"".   
  
X might be medical issues, car repair bills, inability to work, legal fees - it depends on the type of insurance

And the three meals a day rule isn’t actually followed everywhere, there are many places that eat more than 3 “meals”, but they’re typically smaller, so it’s like spread the food you consume out across the day.

But, around 3 is pretty typical.

And for why that is you have to ask why we eat. Because we get hungry. People tend to eat when why’re hungry.

And when are people hungry, well, when they first wake up their stomach is empty from not eating anything all night. (Breakfast)

Then a few hours later their stomach is getting empty again, so they want to eat again (lunch)

And then again towards the end of the day they’re getting chi fry again, (dinner).

It’s just really based off of when people want to eat due to how their natural human digestive system works."

Suffice it to say fighting was much more fluid, with motorized infantry and mechanized and tanks being able to travel fast and advance far.

But doesn’t mean that trenches weren’t a thing anymore. Hard defensive points and trenches still existed and still had to be fought for, they werent as wide spread or as long as those in WW1, but they absolutely still existed in a major fashion.

This actually answers your question.

Humans are the current apex predator. We are the most dangerous mammal to not only the rest of the animal world, but also to ourselves.

Humans kill other humans at massive rates unknown elsewhere in nature.

https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/books/chapters/what-every-person-should-know-about-war.html

&gt; Of the past 3,400 years, humans have been entirely at peace for 268 of them, or just 8 percent of recorded history. 

Humans are the apex predator and humans are our main prey.

&gt; At least 108 million people were killed in wars in the twentieth century.

While accidents and disease obviously account for many more overall deaths, accidents and disease are abstractions which don't *literally* stalk and kill. 

https://ourworldindata.org/homicides

&gt; More than 400,000 people die from homicide each year

&gt; Homicide is a large killer globally – in some countries it’s one of the leading cause of death.

If you look at the linked chart, suicide tops the homicide number, so we are also a huge individual threat to ourselves.

A few hundred thousand years ago, other mammalian predators would have haunted the dreams of humans. That is no longer the case. We are haunted by the serial killer, the despot and the tyrant because humans are now the only real concrete threat to our lives."
OptimusPhillip,1627050836,oq3n2j,"I've been looking deep into the problem of squaring the circle and still can't wrap my head around it.

Effectively, it boils down to making a square and circle with the same area where both the length of the square and the radius of the circle are 'nice' numbers.

The reason that it's impossible is because pi isn't a 'nice' number in that sense.  Or rather, because the square root of pi is transcendental.  This means there's no way to write an equation that uses only positive whole numbers.

Like, there is an answer.  We could draw a circle with an area of 1 and a square with an area of 1.  But the radius of the circle isn't a nice number, which basically means there's no simple way to use geometry to get it."

This gets weird with spottier storms though because a 10% chance of rain might mean that in the next 12 hours only 10% of the area will get rain and it will get a lot, or there's only a 10% chance that the whole area will get rain, or there's a 50% chance that about 20% of the area will get rain.  All of them would result in a 10% chance of rain.  Your individual spot in the forecasted area may have a 0% chance because the storm isn't going that way, but if its done for a big county then you'll get the same 10% chance even though you live in the east half and only the west half is expecting rain

Other places may use smaller time windows.  If you look at a weather forecast for the day and it says 90% chance of rain but then you look at hourly and each hour is only listed as 30% its an indication that they're pretty sure its gonna rain at some point in the day but they're not sure when.

If you apply too much charge to a lithium-ion battery, you can cause thermal run-away (aka, fire). That's pretty bad, so the last bit is charged quite slowly to prevent overcharge."
nontdevil,1627045027,oq1ud4,I just watched a video where they threw hot water and cold water into freezing weather. The hot water freezes a lot faster.

If you put two bottles of water in the freezer, one boiling hot and one at room temperature, the room-temperature water will freeze a lot faster, exactly as common sense dictates.

However, one thing that hot water will do more easily than cold water is *evaporate*. When you throw cold water into the air, it (mostly) just falls down to the ground and makes a splash. When you throw boiling hot water up into the air, a lot of that water will evaporate very quickly, and then immediately after it will condensate into very tiny droplets. And these tiny droplets, because they are so small (specifically, because they have so much surface area compared to their volume), can freeze almost instantly (if the air is cold enough). 

So it's not really the hot temperature of the water that makes it freeze faster - that would be against the laws of physics. What causes the rapid freezing is the water's ability to evaporate quickly, which in turn *is* caused by the hot temperature."

Akira can essentially be bumped up res until the original gets lost, same with restored film although I am of the opinion (a growingly common opinion) that animation doesn't need to be up resed.
As for physical film again as long as it's on tape and not digitally recorded it can be up resed as much as they want,  however unlike animation, there technically will be a point where up ressing it will be completely up to the film quality although again the difference isn't going to be enough to be terribly worried about it. 
Digital animation and film are completely different and use techniques like interpolation and again I don't think they look better after their target render. I.E. avatar was shot and the cgi was rendered at 16;10 1080p (it wasn't but this is an example) which translates nicely to a 16:10 4k display, albeit blurrier but not really noticeably so. What if you want it on a 16:9 display though? Well this is where digital trickery applies, it is still rendering at 2160p however it's horizontal has now been compressed making the resolution not have an even pixel match and slightly damaging the image quality. There are solutions to this,  but technically there is no upper limits, only effective limits, and again I am not a terribly big fan of this solution either.

The reason we don't use that power is that we have no way to harness it - to turn thermal energy into useful work, you need to have a temperature gradient, basically, the heat needs to be able to move from one place to another. The ocean is too cold to be able to move that heat anywhere else easily, so any attempts to generate power with it would take up more energy in moving the heat around than they could gain back.

The ""heat death of the universe"" as it's commonly called, is the point in the very distant future when all of the heat (and other types of energy) are more or less evenly dispersed throughout the universe. Because everything is evenly spread out and at the same temperature, heat can't flow at all and no meaningful physical processes can happen. This also requires almost all matter in the universe to decay (which it eventually will), to prevent other physical processes like gravitational interactions from occuring. At that point, the universe will mostly consist of loose photons and a few very tiny subatomic particles whizzing through the infinite vacuum of perfectly cold, empty space.

Edit: So to answer your questions: No life, no stars, no atoms, pretty much nothing with a mass greater than that of a proton will exist for any meaningful period of time.  Time will keep going on pretty much, well, forever, and it's theorized that fluctuations in the vacuum energy will cause stuff to pop in and out over inconceivable periods of time, though that theory is obviously completely untestable."

There are two things in effect here. Firstly, small things are much more structurally sound than the same thing but bigger. This is because as you increase the apparent size, mass increases exponentially. Imagine a cube that's 2 meters on each edge. This cube's height, length and depth are all 2m. Its volume is 8m^3 (2x2x2), and its surface area is 24m^2 (2x2x6). Now imagine the same cube but 4 meters on each edge. It's volume is 64m^3 (4x4x4), and its surface area is 96m^2 (4x4x6). Its height (how big it looks) has been multiplied by 2, but its volume has been multiplied by 8 and its surface area by 4. A large tunnel has to support *far* more mass proportional to its size than a small tunnel does, so it's more likely to need supporting. 

The second thing is the material in question. Mines are carved into rock, and rock comes in layers. Typically, mines follow one of these layers, because they want to mine whatever's in that layer. The entire layer is made out of the thing they want to mine though, and if they mine the whole thing out, there'll be nothing to support the layer above. Mines must find compromises then - mine out as much of the layer as possible without causing the ceiling to collapse from too much weight being on too little support. Many mines fail to strike the right balance here, because rock layers contain faults and weaknesses that are difficult to predict, and get a partial collapse as the area between two supporting walls caves in. Additional supports can be added to allow more of the layer to be mined without the roof falling.

An ant is not trying to mine coal or iron, nor is it digging through heavy rock layers. Instead, it's burrowing through sand or dirt. This is much lighter, and so its much easier for the sides of the tunnel to support. It's also separated into many grains, so where in a mine an entire rock layer will collapse, in sand and dirt, most collapses are just a few little fragments falling off, instead of the entire thing coming down. Wetness of the particles makes them sticky too, and allows them to hold a shape better. This is particularly effective on the scale of ants because the stickiness force of water works better the smaller you get."

To your other question on why it matters...it's very easy to change the voltage of AC by using a comparatively simple widget called a transformer.

This is not easy to do with DC, and requires much more sophisticated equipment.

AC motors are designed to deal with the reversing current; there are a couple of ways to deal with this but it comes down to making sure you design for the kind of power you're getting. There's a relatively simple device called a rectifier that can turn AC to DC so you can make ""universal motors"" that will run on both AC or DC, but in most cases you have purpose built DC- or AC-motors and they don't work properly if you use them the other way around."

But as it turns out, under our current understanding of mathematics, it's easier to test whether a number is prime than to find its factors! This is one of the really shocking results of a field of math called number theory, which deals with the properties of the positive integers and especially of which integers are factors of which others.

An easy example, and one sometimes used in practice, is the [Miller-Rabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test) test. Miller-Rabin is usually used as a probabilistic test - it only tells you with high probability if a number is prime or not. But similarly fast (for extremely large numbers) deterministic tests like [AKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test) exist too. Miller-Rabin is used because it's simple, because high probability results are good enough for most applications, and because it's fast in practice on the size of number we're actually interested in (something on the order of 128-512 bits or about 40-150 digits).

Miller-Rabin is a slight expansion on the [Fermat primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_primality_test), which is simpler to explain and which I'll describe below.

------

So. We want to figure out a way to test if a number is prime.

One way we can do this is to establish some property that prime numbers have that non-prime numbers either rarely or never do. Then we can test whether a number is prime by testing that property, which is hopefully easier to figure out.

Number theory provides us a useful such property. The property in question is:

a^(n-1) = 1 (mod n) for all positive a &lt; n [from here on I'll assume all the numbers involved are positive, as you often do in number theory]

That (mod n) means that the two numbers differ by some multiple of n, so another way to say this is ""if *n* is prime, a^(n-1) is one more than a multiple of *n* no matter what a you choose, as long as a &lt; n"". Or if you prefer, a^(n-1) = 1 (mod n) means ""a^(n-1) - 1 is divisible by n"".

Let's try it! Suppose I want to know if the number 36 is prime. I pick a random number less than 36. Let's say I pick 3. Then I compute 3^(36-1) and find out what its remainder is if I divide it by 36 (that is, how many more than a multiple of 47 is it?). Computers can do this quickly, and a calculator will tell us that indeed [3^35 = 27 (mod 36)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3%5E35+mod+36). That's not a 1, and therefore we know for sure that 36 is *not* prime. (We can verify this fact by hand, e.g. 36 = 3 \* 12.)

On the other hand, if we tried with 47, we'd get 3^(47-1) = 1 (mod 47). That doesn't guarantee that 47 is prime, because maybe our choice of 3 was lucky, but it is some evidence that 47 is more likely to be prime than it was before. If we kept testing numbers less than 47 and kept getting 1 we'd keep getting more evidence that 47 is more likely to be prime.

Unfortunately, there exist a few non-prime numbers with the same property here that primes have. There are [not very many such numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmichael_number), but they do exist. So even if we tested every number less than 47, we wouldn't be quite sure. Still, this is a pretty useful tool anyway! It will eliminate the vast majority of numbers that aren't prime very quickly.

The Miller-Rabin test improves on this idea by adding an extra property that *is* only true for primes, so that repeated tests *do* give you very high certainty that the number *is* prime."

The Patriarchy^TM is basically just the result of thousands of years of history in which who was best at hitting each other with big sticks determined who got to be in charge of stuff. It's really interesting history though.

In the early tribal phase of human civilisation, being able to hit other tribes with big sticks was very important, because if you didn't hit them with big sticks and take all their stuff, they'd hit you with big sticks and take all your stuff. Now, not everyone is good at hitting people with big sticks. Particularly, women, children and the elderly are generally not very good at hitting people with big sticks, and most adult men weren't great at it either due to lacking skill, resources or both. It's also not usually a good idea to hit *all* the people with big sticks, because then you have to do all the work involved in taking their stuff yourself. The first ruling classes were established to solve the problems of how not everyone was good at hitting people with big sticks and how the people who were good at hitting people with big sticks didn't want to have to do a lot of hard work. In these societies, the people who were bad at hitting people with big sticks would farm and make things, and give some of the stuff they farm and make to the people who are good at hitting people with big sticks. In exchange, the people who are good at hitting people with big sticks would protect the farmers and makers from other people with big sticks who might come to hit them. In practice though, the people who are good at hitting people with big sticks get to call all the shots, because there's not much you can do about unfair conditions when the people being unfair are better with big sticks than you are. 

The people who are good at hitting people with big sticks are naturally going to structure their dominions in a way that will bring the most benefit to themselves, because that's just how people work. They appreciate sustainability and stability, and they also appreciate things going their way. One thing that is very beneficial to men is when women are exclusive property. Back then, children died a lot because they sucked at not getting diseases. This means you need a lot of children to have a good chance of your children being as successful as you are, and it takes time for women to make children. You also really don't want the child that gets made to be someone else's child, because that just means more competition against your own children. This means that humans have evolved to make men quite competitive. They innately want to maximise the success rate of their own sperm. This is where the perceived value of the virgin comes from - the first person to impregnate a virgin is definitely going to get their own baby, there's no chance of getting anyone else's. So, these societies become structured in ways that we would consider deeply problematic today, in which women were property who existed to propagate the genes of the people who are good at hitting people with big sticks. This is also why the god in the Old Testament is a right wanker who orders his followers to commit genocides and mass rapes - because this was  the most effective strategy a tribe could assume back then, and it was useful to justify these actions through a godly figure. 

Another useful thing you can do when you're organising your society to work best for the people who are good at hitting people with big sticks is codify that women are property and should be treated as such, with restrictions on what they're allowed to do. A society in which the life of a woman comprises of waiting to get married, getting married and then having a bunch of kids is a society that optimises the propagation of genes for the people who are good at hitting people with big sticks. This is mostly designed to benefit the ruling class, but since there are people who look like they're good at hitting people with big sticks in the peasant class too, these people also benefit from these rules, and you get peasants marrying and peasant societies deliberately advantaging men too. This becomes ingrained in the core of the culture through gender roles, and we're still seeing remnants of this societal structure today, although it is so much better today in most countries that it's not really comparable. 

Also, a thing to bear in mind here is that the power in the modern world is not new power. The story of the self-made millionaire is largely a myth. Of course, some people do it, but the vast majority of the power in the world is power people were born into, power accumulated by hitting people with big sticks and passed down through the generations even as hitting people with big sticks stopped being important. Sometimes this is through direct and obvious benefits like large inheritances and trust funds, but it's also through the benefits of your parents being middle class, which is the single biggest determining factor for whether you will be middle class. The powerful in the modern world are not a reflection of the society of the modern world, but are the legacy of past societies."

Normal atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psi but we'll use 15 for easy math.  If you have a little 20 liter air compressor then the air in the tank normally weighs 25 grams which isn't much.  If you turn on the compressor and bring the tank up to 15 psi (gauge pressure so its atmospheric+15=30 psi absolute) you now have twice as much air in the tank so it will weigh an extra 25 grams.  You're not worried about the 15 pounds that it says on the gauge because that is pushing outwardly inside the tank and only applies to the walls of the tank, not to the force you need to lift it.

If you turn the pump up to 150 PSI (pretty high for a home shop) then the tank has 11x as much air in it and weighs an extra 275 grams, not too much.

Lets say you get a really good compressor to go with your piddly tank and get it up to 3000 psi.  You now have 200x as much air in the same volume so it weighs an extra 5 kg which is significant.

First, why shouldn’t you? Because you will crash your car, either by skidding or rolling. The car has a lot of momentum trying to move it forward and if you ask the tires so change direction too much and too quickly, they won’t be able to. 

Secondly, why can’t you? Well, you can but it’s just harder. And it’s harder because cars are specifically designed to make it harder.

Here’s a mini-history of power steering. In the beginning there was no power steering. The steering wheel was directly connected to the wheels, and it was quite hard to steer. When maneuvering at slow speeds where you wanted to turn the wheels a lot, it was really hard. You needed quite a lot of strength. 

Then came power steering. When you turned the steering wheel, the car would detect it and help you turn. It became much easier to steer than before, particularly when you wanted to turn the wheels a lot. 

However there was a problem at high speeds. It was so easy to turn that when to turned the wheel just a little bit, like you want at high speed, it felt like the steering wheel was just floating: there wasn’t enough control. 

So they made adaptive power steering (or various other phrases for the same thing). It was designed so that at low speeds it would help you turn the steering wheel a lot, to allow you to maneuver easily, and at high speeds it would hardly help at all so you felt like you had control, and didn’t turn the wheels too much by mistake."

This can be fixed, but it will take a little training and effort. Fortunately that's not super difficult for an adult to achieve in a few weeks (assuming there's no learning disability). You just have to practice things like decomposing numbers into 10s. Eg your example 77+79 could be 70+70+7+9. 70+70 is 140. 7+9 is 16. 140+16 is now a pretty easy operation.

A vectorised function is a function that takes as an input a vector of things, rather than a single thing.

The function g that takes a vector of number and spits out a vector with the double of each number of the vector is vector function. Say g([1,3,4]) = [2, 6, 8].

In some circumstances, you can easily take a function like f and ""vectorize"" it. In this case, this would yield the function g.


Why is this relevant? Your computer might be faster (for plenty of reasons) when it processes a whole vector at once rather than processing each thing one by one.

Inkjets are a con.  Total, 100% waste of money.

Cheap printers can't feed paper properly, because you need a bit of solid structure, good motors and tight rollers to handle paper sensibly.

USB printers all need specific drivers.  Steer clear of them.  The drivers are trash that some guy wrote 20 years ago and now the printer firmware and driver themselves are handling a bunch of legacy code that doesn't work well on modern OS because it tries to do far too much.

Wireless printers are just awful - wireless things in general are pretty awful at maintaining a stable connection.  Bluetooth, the same.  Sometimes you have to use it, but pretty much just stick a cable in wherever possible.

There's a reason that businesses use:  Good quality, brand-name, Ethernet-connected, driverless, Postscript-compatible laser printers.  It eliminates 99% of the problems people have with printers.

Also, steer away from anything to do with fancy add on features.  You don't need a menu on your damn printer.  It just needs to print.  Print/copy/scan/fax, it's going to need drivers and monitoring software and it's going to go wrong.

Printers are no more or less reliable than other hardware, they just have more things that could happen.  Paper handling is very tricky.  Toners need replacing, and they are dusts that you're melting onto paper, it's a hard thing to do.  The components in the machines are moving parts, so they have friction, wear-and-tear and can jam.

Just by selecting the right ingredients and proccessing them in different ways will produce different tastes in the beer. You can get citrus beers without citrus but where they only use citrus hops, coffee stout can be made without coffee by burning the malt in a way that brings out the burned coffee taste, etc. And even getting the right malt burning process and masking temperature can produce the right types of sugars you want. The fruits and other flavoring is often added in addition to these basic flavors already in the beer to reinforce them and add to them. Sometimes you do also see microbreweries save a batch of beer by adding flavors to it, a tradition which goes back hundreds of years.

I am not as femilear with wine but I do know of a few wines that have addatives to them in addition to grapes. You can indeed create some interesting and exiting flavors of wine in this way. So your question about cherry in the wine was not all that silly. It might be that the winery actually did use cherry but found it prudent to not advertise this too much. But they might not have added much. Some rasberry beers are made by adding just a handfull of berries to the wort as most of the taste comes from the yeast that lives on raspberry.

Flowers that bloom rarely have invested heavily in option A above. You will almost certainly find that the bloom coincide with a very specific insect that also adopts the same cycle. That insect is attracted to this plant, so the plant can basically ensure that the pollen in the flower is guaranteed to end up on another member if its species.

- Gravitational interactions are also limited by the speed of light. So if our Sun suddenly disappeared, Earth wouldn't feel the gravitational effect (or sudden lack thereof) for 8 minutes. So gravity effects are not instant - nothing (no ""information"") can travel faster than the speed of light.


- Gravity therefore does not affect other objects instantly. That ""information"" takes time to travel between objects.


- It follows then, that if light/radiation (even if very weak) can reach us from millions of light years away, then gravity, however weak, could as well.


- Gravitational effects do weaken over long distances but not necessarily to zero. I don't think we know that for certain though. Something would have to ""absorb"" that energy. I'm not sure if there is any theory currently that suggests space itself absorbs gravitational energy or not (like how water ripples lose their energy to the surrounding water). That would be interesting to know.


- It's possible that gravity from a distant object can be affected by other gravitational fields it passes through on the way and perhaps be further weakened in that way. Not sure on theories about that specifically.


- I would hypothesise that yes, the universe is awash in gravitational effects from all sources (within ""range"" - see below), just as it is awash in radiation from all sources, however weak they might be. But it's always ""old information"", having travelled there at light speed from somewhere.


- Some gravity from far away definitely does *not* reach us, according to the theory that many stars are so far away from us that, due to rapid expansion of the universe in between us and them, their light will never reach us (and therefore neither will their gravity effects)."

Hi everyone,

Recently, i was studying the electronic distribution of atoms and it was all going fine until it got to the part about spin. My textbook presented spin as if it was just a fat with no causes or consequences, which is weird, since my physics teacher always tells us to try to contextualize as much as possible. So i decided to do some research into why electrons spin, and what they do.

  I've spent pretty much the whole day trying to understand what causes the electron to spin, and what arises from it, but I still couldn't find a satisfactory answer. At first, I read that the spin of electrons create the magnetic field of an atom, but then another page told me that it has little do with it. Then, there's a whole thing that they don't actually spin at all, which confused me even further. 

To be frank I'm completely lost in the matter, and I would appreciate any direction as to Why and How the electron spins, and if the spin is what creates the magnetic field or not. 

Thanks,

What mathematicians call a *space* is just a set of directions. Basically, if you have ""one step forward"" and ""one step to the right"", you have a space! You've got directions, you can multiply the directions to move more or less, the entire shebang.

Now for a Hilbert space, you need to add two more conditions:

* It needs to support multiplication (not all spaces do that!)
* If you've got a series of numbers that seem to get closer and closer to one number, that final number — called the limit — needs to be inside the space.

For example: if you take the list of number that are 1 divided by something: for 10 it's 0.1, for 100 it's 0.01, for a million it's 0.000001... it gets closer and closer to 0 but **never reaches 0**. So 0 is the limit for the series of numbers ""one divided by x"". That means any space that can contain the numbers of the series should also have 0 in it, or it isn't a Hilbert space.

Whew. Now with all this mathematical mumbo jumbo, what can we do?

Math is a game of definitions and their consequences. Once we define what a Hilbert space is, we can look at how it works and find useful properties.

One of them is right there in the definition: wanna know if a series will have a limit or not? Instead of proving that it does reach a certain number, which is often hard, just prove that it gets closer and closer to it and show that the numbers of your series live in a Hilbert space, which is easy. Boom, job done, you know there's a solution that exists. Knowing that a solution exists is sometimes more important than the solution itself, especially if you don't want to waste hours looking for it!"

To talk about this we need to distinguish between two things: suffering an nociception.

Nociception is a reaction to a stimulus which could be dangerous. For example, you touch something hot and instinctively draw your hand away. If you think about it, that can happen before you actually experience any pain. And we can see it in incredibly simple organisms - an amoeba can move away from something dangerous.

But can we say an amoeba experiences pain? That question is a little more complicated - what precisely do we mean by ""experience pain""? There are some tests biologists use - like do creatures learn to avoid a stimulus in the future - but they might well both be too much and too little. You could program a computer to learn to avoid 'dangerous' stimuli but that doesn't mean it's experiencing pain. Experiencing a feeling suggests some level of subjective consciousness.

Now it's pretty clear that amoeba don't really have this kind of mental experience of feelings. But somewhere between amoeba and humans there must be shades of grey. Where that line is is really complicated from both a scientific and an ethical point of view.

This distinction also means that animals might *look* like they're experiencing pain when actually they're not - for example they might pull sharply back from something hot, just like we would. But there's no subject inside that body experience a feeling, just a bunch of instinctive or learnt reactions.

*Personally* I draw a line at invertebrates and think their brains and nervous systems aren't sufficiently developed for us to be concerned about them experiencing pain. Though I do have to make an exception to that for cephalopods - octopus, squid and cuttlefish."

There is a little gear in the transmission that is turned by the transmission output shaft (that's the one connected to the road wheels). A flexible cable is attached to that gear, so that as the car moves faster down the road, the gear is spun faster which spins the cable.

The cable runs to the dash and into the back of the speedometer. There, it is attached to a magnet which spins. Then, a metal disk is placed near the magnet. As the magnet spins, it will ""drag"" or pull the metal disk along with it, and the faster the magnet spins, the more it drags on the disk. To the disk is attached the speedometer needle, and a return spring tries to keep the needle at zero. So the faster you go, the metal disk overpowers the spring, and the needle climbs.

This system had an unfortunate side effect that the cable would require lubrication, and would wear out. On my '88 VW Fox for example, on winter mornings the speedo would make an awful squealing sound as the lube in the cable had solidified in the cold.

An electronic ""analog-style"" needle gauge takes a digital signal from either the transmission or from the road wheels themselves, and a [stepper motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor) moves the needle to the appropriate position calculated by the computer.

If Amazon fulfills something for a 3rd party, they don't have to deal with ordering inventory, but they do have to deal with managing it. They charge the 3rd party a fee for this. If a 3rd party does the entire fulfillment process, they charge a smaller fee as a broker.

Second is subscription services like Prime. Basically, Amazon offers various web services that you can pay into, most of which are under the Prime umbrella. This is recurring revenue for something offered as a service, which means it is significantly more scalable than shipping stuff.

The third is AWS. This is where they manage a lot of physical server/networking infrastructure, and let people rent it. A significant portion of the websites you go to run on servers operated by AWS. They kind of stumbled into this one. Back in the day, they wanted to do away with everyone having to request everything from every department in various emails that would be potentially lost. Instead, they required departments to expose what they offered to other departments programatically. This meant their IT department created ways of allocating virtual servers for other departments in a way that was programmatic. Then, when they realized that every year, they had to expand their server capacity for Black Friday - Christmas, but then idle those servers for most of the year, they realized they could sell this server space using that programmatic tooling. This was AWS.

As for a breakdown, let's look at two things. First is Revenue, which is just a sum of Money-In for any given service. Second is Operating Income, which is Money-In minus the costs directly incurred for that income. AWS is about 10-15% of the revenue for Amazon, but as much as 60% of their Operating Income. This is because the overhead for the online store is huge compared to AWS. 

One important thing is that Amazon is AWS's own biggest customer. They track cross-department spending the same way as any other big company. For instance, a service like Twitch depends on a lot of AWS infrastructure. They want to make sure that they track the appropriate amount of money that AWS is generating, even if Twitch was sold off."

The more interesting question is why PC-DVDs used the larger casing. There I think it was a combination of marketing (""look, this is a DVD not a CD, so is better, so we can charge more"") and smaller total packaging; PC-CDs tended to come in the smaller cases, but inside larger boxes (where there was room for the manuals and other paperwork). With the larger DVD cases there was more room for paperwork inside the case, so no need for the larger box (making them easier to store, transport and display).

An example would be a ledge that is too high for the player to reach until they have found double-jump somewhere in the world that allows them to reach the high ledge and move to the area behind it. However double jumping will be a permanent part of the player's moveset and will allow them more mobility. Thus the world and how you traverse it constantly changes as you get more and more moves and skills that change how your character can move.

Open worlds tend to be, well, open. You can get more or less everywhere if you want, and if sections of the world are locked they are locked behind story progression, not mechanical progression. The player generally won't discover mechanics that enable them to more easily access new areas, but instead will complete quests or missions that open the new areas up. An example would be a city that the player isn't allowed in to until they have earned the guard's trust by killing ten orcs in the mountain or whatever.

This does not mean we can calculate the unobservable universe because it's possible the universe is infinite. Now, things start getting a bit counter intuitive when infinities are involved, but the big bang isn't when the entire universe was squished into a single point, but rather the universe was compressed everywhere to a state of infinite density.

Imagine you have a bed sheet on a bed and you reach out and you grab a handful and you crumple it together. So now you have a smooth bedsheet with one crumpled spot. Now imagine you did this for every spot on the bedsheet. Now you have a fully crumpled bedsheet. Now imagine the bedsheet is infinite in all directions but you're still able to crumple every spot.

A medication called tranexamic acid is often used to help control bleeding along with physical methods of bandaging and packing the wound. If a patient is on blood thinners they'll often receive a medication to temporarily reverse the effects of their blood thinner so that their wound can clot.

Christian_1X460,1626835830,ooh88n,I've heard that interest is when someone borrows your money they pay back extra for borrowing it. is this true?,explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How does inflation and interest work?,"'h5yhc7v', 'h5yht7j', 'h5ylbjc', 'h5yuzea', 'h5yvhld', 'h63gelr'",6,"True. If you lend me $1000 for a year at a rate of 5% interest per year (for the sake of simplicity, we'll ignore the issue of compounding), then that means that after one year, I have to pay you back the original $1000 plus 5% - that is, I have to pay you back $1050.

Interest is mainly compensation for risk. There's a risk that I might not be able to pay you back all - or even any! - of the $1000 when the year is up. If you lent me the money at zero interest, there would be a significant potential downside for you, and no upside. In other words, you would have no reason to lend me the money, unless I were a close relative, or your best friend, or had dirt on you, or something. But if you charge interest, now there's a potential upside for you that compensates for the potential downside of me not repaying the money.

This is why, as a rule, the riskier the loan, the higher the rate of interest. 

Interest is also compensation for the fact that you won't have easy access to the money for the year that you lend it to me. (This is called the ""time value of money"".) 

Finally, interest is also compensation for the other thing you asked about - inflation. 

Inflation is a rise in the general price level. 5% annual inflation means that prices of goods and services have, on the whole, risen by 5% in a year. If you lend me the $1000 at 5% interest, and I pay you back the full $1050, but there was also 5% inflation that year, then you've really gotten screwed, since now you need $1050 just to buy the same stuff that would have cost you $1000 last year. In practical terms, you've gained nothing - the effect is the same as if you'd lent the money at zero interest.

This is why the expected rate of inflation generally gets incorporated into the interest rate. If you'd had a crystal ball and could see that there was going to be 5% inflation in the coming year, it would have been rational for you to charge me 10% interest instead of 5%, in order to cancel out the effect of the inflation."

The Sun is the hardest target to hit in the Solar System.  It would take the most energy to get a spacecraft to the Sun than it would to go anywhere else in the Solar System.   

This may seem weird but here's why.

The Earth is orbiting the Sun at about 30kps relative to the Sun.  If you want to travel to the outer planets you need to get a bit more speed to get out there.  The fastest craft at launch was New Horizons at about 16kps (relative to the Earth) so it could get out to Pluto.

However, to hit the Sun you actually need to slow down.......... a lot.  Remember, that rocket just sitting on the ground is going 30kps around the Sun.  The rocket would need to take off and then remove most of that velocity to be able to hit the Sun, otherwise it'd miss.  There's no difference in energy expenditure in getting a rocket to go 30kps faster relative to the Sun and getting it to go 30kps slower relative to the Sun.

The consumer is paying more which the business then passes on to the worker (more likely, but still doesn't feel right).  The businesses are paying wages utilizing credit (unsustainable?). Is all of this money simply a function of profound inflation?

Am I simply not paying close enough attention, and am actually paying more for goods and services? Would this system not eventually drive down the number of consumers? Will wages eventually be driven back down as job competition increases?

This was a few decades ago so specifics could have changed but the overall concept remains the same and is likely the answer you are looking for.  It's a slew of much more complex chemical reactions than you would think that only provide estimates.

With fat you can take advantage of the fact that it won't dissolve in water.  A 5 year old reason for this is because H2O has a bend in it meaning it's less symmetrical than fat/oil/lipids so we call water polar (North and South parts are different) while fat is non-polar.  Grind the food up real good and you can then do a wash and measure what's in the polar section.

Protein is way more complicated.  There exists a relationship between the amount of the chemical Nitrogen and the amount of protein though.  Like one protein has one nitrogen or something (but totally not that simple).  Therefore you can do a whole series of chemical reactions (think blending it, burning it, mixing in acid, precipitating out crystals, etc.) to find the amount of nitrogen and then come up with a figure for protein.

Measuring carbs would be much more complicated, but fortunatly we already have fat and protein covered so just assume the rest is carbs.

The _how_ is very complicated and these days involves lots of machine learning, but the general idea is that they look for patterns near the area being removed and infer details based on the patterns.

Old algorithms would try to continue nearby patterns across the removed area.  This worked pretty well when the background was a simple repeating pattern, like brickwork or grass, but did really poorly when important things were obviously changing behind the removed object.

With machine learning, the model can infer the existence of more complicated backgrounds given clues.  For example, if it sees a doorframe surrounding a person that you want to remove, it can infer the existence of a door behind the person and fill in details accordingly.  It ""knows"" about doors and doorframes because it was trained on many pictures with doors in doorframes and has stored that information in some format during its training. 

Machine learning models do not ""understand"" photos the same way that humans do, so the exact way that this happens is poorly understood and often unreliable.  It generally creates better results than earlier ""copy a pattern"" algorithms did."

Dark_T100,1626809508,oo98x2,"In one of my late night trances into the deepest and dankest corners of the web, I read this on [Wikipedia's page on the history of Deep Sea exploration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep-sea_exploration)

&gt;In general, modern scientific deep-sea exploration can be said to have begun when French scientist Pierre Simon de Laplace investigated the average depth of the Atlantic ocean by observing tidal motions registered on Brazilian and African coasts. He calculated the depth to be 3,962 metres (12,999 ft), a value later proven quite accurate by echo-sounding measurement techniques.


How did my man Laplace, who has humbled me in so many calc classes, figure this out? What was his intuition? I tried following the citation link but it was fruitless. I have found this page on the [Theory of tides](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_tides&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPsPf_0PHxAhVHHc0KHXfqChcQFjADegQILxAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw1FE4wpjDLESuu5VFMXe9LH) as well as this link to a paper of [""A derivation of Laplace’s tidal equation from the theory of inertial oscillations""](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.1975.0090%23:~:text%3DLaplace%27s%2520tidal%2520equation%2520is%2520derived,acceleration%2520is%2520not%2520neglected%2520explicitly.&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPsPf_0PHxAhVHHc0KHXfqChcQFjABegQIFRAF&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ZwC3ucBeL99WpuyijnY4r).

Thanks!",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How did Laplace calculate the depth of the Atlantic Ocean using tide motions?,"'h5wym9e', 'h5x033j', 'h5x0ttg', 'h5x2oj9', 'h5x4ejd', 'h5y8zc9', 'h5yerbo', 'h5yftv3'",8,"There is no good way to explain this like you're five, but I'll try and simplify as much as I can.

Basically Laplace created a series of differential equations to model tides. He had three equations one that was for the rate of change of tidal elevation, and two were for the rate of change of the components horizontal velocity (modern versions will use linear algebra and the curl operator to simplify down to two equations). In those equations is a value called the total gravitational potential. When you solve for that one of the thin gs that comes up is the depth of the body of water subject to the tidal forces.

So when you actually look at the actual values for the tides you can then find values for your depth that fit the equation.

If you want to really dig into it you can find stuff here: 

tidal equations: https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336L/Fluid/node170.html

total Gravitational potential: [https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336L/Fluid/node168.html#e41](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336L/Fluid/node168.html#e41)

&amp;#x200B;

To simply put it. When the moon is overhead it works in opposition to the earths gravity, and essentially lowers the amount of gravity. Gravitational potential is based  on how much gravity there is and how much stuff it's pulling. If there's more water there's more potential energy, and when the moon reduces the gravity more potential energy is lost. That loss causes tides. Laplace looked at the tides and figured out how much potential energy had been lost, then figured out how deep the water had to be through that."

One is that we didn't have the technology previously to diagnose people with Celiac or NCGS.

There is such a thing as asymptomatic Celiac, so people don't know they have it. Celiac can lead to bowel cancer, bone density issues, vitamin deficiencies, etc. So there may have been many people with chronic health issues that just weren't diagnosed properly or weren't able to be diagnosed. 

Sick kids also just died. Especially poor sick kids. We have a lot more nutrients in our food now and are overall much healthier, so a sickly kid could survive to adulthood and get diagnosed. Previously, many children died. I know you've heard about this historically. 

Celiac is also genetic. So as our population increases, diagnosis will increase. We're learning more about it, which leads to an increase in diagnoses.

Lastly, the fad dieters have grabbed onto gluten-free eating as part of a trendy diet, so you have more people claiming issues when in reality they may not have an issue. I don't believe that this is common at all, but it does happen."

The alcohol prevents this reabsorbtion and all that water heads to your bladder along with the small amount of filtered waste.

This is obviously more likely to happen at higher concentration.

This is the biggest thing: The amount of Covid is in the air is the most important factor.

By wearing masks, **most** of the particles you exhale will be trapped in your mask. This reduces the concentration in the air around you and makes it safer for every other person in the room.

Each rifle is a bit different. The bolt does not hold the bullet straight in the chamber, the barrels are not completely straight, the crown does not release the bullet perfectly, the sights are on a bit crooked, etc. These are all too small on most rifles that you can not measure them. They might even change depending on temperature. So the only way for sure to know the exact trajectory that the rifle sets their bullets on is to fire the rifle and measure where the bullet hits. You then adjust the sights so to the center of this cluster. That means that the bullets will go where you point the sights. If conditions changes, changes to the rifle, remounting the sights, new type of ammunition or even just large temperatue changes you need to rezero the rifle.

In addition to the zero of the sights there are also lots of other factors you need to adjust for the specific conditions. The most important is the bullet drop at different distances but also the wind. So a lot of sights have two sets of adjustments, one for zeroing and one for elevation and windage with marked gradients so you can easily adjust it back to zero."

First of all, that ""Audiophile Voices"" CD is part of a series of recordings which have been mastered differently from the album versions using an audio processor called ""XRCD"", which is some kind of secret-sauce enhancement effect cooked up by JVC. I don't know exactly what XRCD does to 'enhance' the sound, but the 'resolution' bit in the name is a misnomer: XRCD-encoded CDs are 16 bit, 44.1KHz PCM audio, exactly like every other standard CD. It's not any higher resolution mathematically, but they may be processing the audio so that it subjectively *feels* higher definition. It's similar to how you can turn up the ""sharpness"" of an image in photoshop, but this doesn't leave you with any more pixels than you had before.

A lot of different audio effects can change the perceived ""quality"" of a recording, without necessarily being any more accurate or high definition. A common one is to use equalization to change the relative loudness of the high, low, and midrange frequencies in the mix. (If your stereo has 'graphic EQ', you can make these kinds of modifications to the sound yourself to your own taste. Try pushing the mids down a bit and the highs and lows up a bit. A lot of people find those settings sound more audiophile-y.)

So the actual audio data which was uploaded in the first place, is probably different between these versions.

And then, like you alluded to, there's the encoding and transcoding happening on the streaming platform. YouTube does actually allow you to upload the audio in a lossless format. You can't just upload a FLAC file, because that's not a video format, but there are lots of video stream container formats (such as .mkv, .mov, .avi, .mp4...) and many of them actually do allow you to include an uncompressed, or losslessly compressed audio stream. But my experience as a musician uploading to YouTube, has been that YouTube prepares compressed video streams for playback and kind of lock the audio and video quality settings to each other. (If you upload a 320x240 video with a perfectly lossless audio stream in it, it will be transcoded to a ""low quality"" preset and your audio will be much more mangled.)

But looking at your links, it's the ""audiophile"" upload which is a low res video, not to mention being uploaded 10 years earlier, back when codecs were worse. So I think it's much more likely that you're responding to the first thing, the different mastering process."

Basically, you can only build straight up from the property you own, you can’t overhang other peoples property.

Unless of course, you lease/purchase their air rights.

Say you want to add some extra square footage or balconies to your brand new apartment building, but you’ve run out of space on your property and would need to overhang the neighbors, you could say, “hey neighbor, I’ll pay you 1.7 million dollars if you let us build over your property a bit.”

And if the neighbor doesn’t care, they’ll take the money, or if they want to preserve their space, they’ll tell you to take a hike."

Philosophically, it comes from the idea that it's better for the community to have all property in the hands of people who will care for it and improve it.  Imagine that Owner owns a plot of land and just ignores it, but Squatter comes in and builds a house there and Owner doesn't do anything about it.  Squatter has actually provided value to the community and is viewed by the law as deserving the land more than Owner does.  Now, the law still gives Owner a chance to stop it early in the process, but the law also has a principle, called laches, that if you unnecessarily delay in getting the court involved, you forfeit your right to complain.

No, because one of the requirements for adverse possession under the common law is ""notorious and open"" possession.  Squatter has to be blatant to anyone near the property that Squatter is in the process of claiming the property for himself."

Nuclear bombs work by a chain reaction. When you hit a uranium nucleus with a neutron, it will fission. This releases energy, daughter nuclei and 3 more neutrons. These neutrons go on to strike more uranium nuclei which themselves fission and release more neutrons which strike more uranium and so on. Every stage of this releases energy as heat.

(Mammal secret weapon.)

But your immunity to something isn't the same as having high antibody levels all the time. That would be exhausting for your immune system and probably raises the risk of some kind of allergy or excessive immune response. 

So most of the time most of your immunities aren't actively producing antibodies. You have memory cells but no antigen, no antibodies. And for this reason antibody tests are better at showing that you are immune to an infectious disease *that you were recently exposed to.* After a few months, usually, the antibodies become much less common.

There's no placental immune system transfer (or from mother to egg) for a couple of reasons. But the big one is that would also be a good way to inherit parasites or cancer. Pretty much all complex organisms use reproduction as an opportunity to get a clean slate, no more parasites.

Many fish completely change their habitat when spawning, from salt to fresh water or vice versa. Like salmon for example. Ocean fish that spawns in fresh water. The adults die after spawning, which kills most parasites. Any surviving parasites (or eggs or cists) then find themselves in fresh water instead of salt. Bad news for them.

Finally, you probably don't want to remember immune patterns for too long because pathogens almost always evolve quickly. Imagine trying to keep 10,000 years of flu data! So resetting every generation is a convenient way to do that."

If you're close to an extremely massive object like that, time does appear to move slower for you than for an outside observer. Conversely, you would see that observer's time moving faster than your own -- that's why only a few hours on the water planet corresponded to several years back aboard the ship, which is farther away from the black hole. The black hole is also pretty accurate in terms of how it looks, although they altered it somewhat to appear more appealing to an audience.

The Earth could become less habitable, that is hotter and less conducive to crop growth, in the future, even our lifetime. Some people have thought of the ""escape plan"" idea of sending humans to other planets to save people and continue the species. The technology to send humans to live on Mars exists right now, but the conditions of Mars will probably always be worse than here on Earth, unless Earth's atmosphere experiences a runaway greenhouse effect that turns it into something similar to Venus. Earth-like planets where we could go and immediately live comfortably are, if anywhere, in other solar systems extremely far away, and the technology to send people to them doesn't currently exist. However, the movie offers a ""natural"" solution to the problem of getting there ...

Wormholes are a theoretical object, and while they're a solution to the equations of general relativity, they've never been observed. Many theories exist on how a wormhole could exist and be sustained, ranging from matter with negative mass to extra spatial dimensions. If they do exist, it's doubted that they would naturally be found large and stable (long-lived) enough for a spaceship to pass through. IIRC however the wormhole in the movie was purposefully placed there by an advanced race, though. The ability to do this is completely speculative.

The part where what's-his-name falls into the black hole and floats around a higher-dimensional space where he can communicate with his daughter in the past is soft sci-fi. By all our understanding of relativity and black holes, it's not accurate, but the creators of the movie chose to forgo that accuracy for the purpose of emotional depth and to create a more surprising plot point."

You could instead keep the stock and use it as collateral for a loan.  You can get a cheap interest rate because it's very easy for a lender to seize and sell stock.  You can basically cash in some of the increased value without paying taxes.

There are some catches to this:

- If you eventually sell the stock, you do have to pay taxes.
- You can't just keep the borrowed money indefinitely.  You have to pay the loan back over time, with interest.
- Borrowing with stock as collateral significantly increases your risk of being completely wiped out in a downturn.

So does that mean that on a storage device somewhere that is stored right now on a server?

Yes, that's exactly what that means.

&gt;I get that a bit can be 'on or off' 'true or false' but how does that become useful?

Because there are a lot of things that can only be in one of two states. Truth statements about the world can be true or false. Magnetic fields can be North or South. Spots on a CD can be light or dark, smooth or divoted. Electrical currents can be high or low voltage.

Let's use the last one as our main example. I can take some transistors and create an electrical circuit with two inputs and one output such that, if both inputs have high voltage, the output is high, but in any other case, the output is low. Let's call this circuit AND.

I can create another circuit with 2 inputs and 1 output but with a different rule. This one outputs high voltage if both inputs are different (one is high and the other is low) and outputs low voltage of both inputs are the same (both high or both low). Let's call this circuit XOR.

Lastly, let's say that the two inputs from both circuits are the same. That is I have two electrical feeds (call them A and B) that connect to both of these circuits. I can create a table that represents all the possibilities:

&amp;#x200B;

|A Input|B Input|AND Output|XOR Output|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LOW|LOW|LOW|LOW|
|LOW|HIGH|LOW|HIGH|
|HIGH|LOW|LOW|HIGH|
|HIGH|HIGH|HIGH|LOW|

Now, instead of viewing these as the electrical voltages they are, I can treat them as 1's and 0's. I can say a High Voltage means ""1"" and a Low Voltage means ""0"". Here is the table again:

&amp;#x200B;

|A Input|B Input|AND Output|XOR Output|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0|0|0|0|
|0|1|0|1|
|1|0|0|1|
|1|1|1|0|

If we treat each of the inputs as a number but then combine the outputs into a single number, we can see that what we have here is single-bit addition:

0 + 0 = 00

0 + 1 = 01

1 + 0 = 10

1 + 1 = 10

Congratulations, we've created an electronic circuit to add a single bit.

From here we can basically do anything we want following this kind of logic and build ever more complex circuits that do what we want."
ScaredOfLife666,1626641993,omz986,"I'm 19 and while I respect my elders and all, I've been confused by the concept of ""life experience"". 

To me, life experience just sounds like having experience in understanding yourself, what you value, what works for you when approaching the world, etc. Essentially how you live your life on a personal level. 

What I've noticed is that there is a TON of variance in how people choose to live their lives. My grandpa tells me to not get married and says it comes from a place of wisdom. My grandma says the opposite but it still comes from a place of wisdom.

To me, it makes zero sense. If life is incredibly personal, and there is a lot of variance in what is considered ideal, why would you listen to someone else's ""wisdom"" for living life? It would be one thing if all old people agreed on something. But they don't. 

To me, it just sounds like someone decided something worked or didn't work for them and want to either share this joy or pain to younger generations. This is VERY understandable, but there is just way too much variance in lives to take it seriously.

This question is also applied to planets being bigger than their respective moons.",explainlikeimfive,ELi5 Why are stars typically bigger than planets?,"'h5nj95j', 'h5njivv', 'h5njn62', 'h5nkv97', 'h5nlyub', 'h5nmkoc', 'h5np4ik', 'h5op05g'",8,"Because this is how we define stars, planets and moons.

For planets and moons this is easy. If planets weren't bigger than their moons they wouldn't be planets. Moons are things that orbit planets. Orbiting is based on relative mass (smaller things orbit bigger things), so if a planet had a moon bigger than it, the planet would be the moon and the moon the planet. If they were similar sizes they'd orbit around each other, and wouldn't count as proper planets - instead being maybe dwarf planets or something similar.

For stars and planets we need to be careful what we mean by ""bigger."" What makes stars stars and not planets is that they are *massive* enough (so have enough mass) that the are undergoing nuclear fusion. If you get enough mass together in one region, gravity pulls it in hard enough that the stuff starts squishing in awkward ways and explodes. Stars are a balance between gravity imploding the stuff they're made of, and fusion exploding it again.

So generally stars need to be larger in size than planets because - roughly speaking - stars and planets are made up of the same stuff, and if planets were bigger they'd probably have enough mass to start exploding and turn into stars.

That said, you do get some very small stars. Based on [this list of small stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_smallest_stars), around 20 of them are smaller than Jupiter - mostly White Dwarf stars and Neutron Stars. These are incredibly dense - they may have similar amounts of mass to the Sun (so enough mass to undergo fusion and so be stars), but that mass is squished down to an object maybe on a few kilometres across for the smallest.

To quote [Wikipedia's definition of a planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet):

&gt; A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is **not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion,** and ... **has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals**.

Roughly speaking, if a planet is too big and massive, it fails that first highlighted part and becomes a star. If a planet is too small it fails that second highlighted part and becomes a moon, natural satellite, dwarf planet or something else."

After not very many generations, any recessive genes that lead to death become highly pronounced. So, if one of the original people carries the gene for, say, a heart problem that can kill somebody very young, the likelihood that it will be expressed compounds in their offspring. We could argue that those with said heart condition don't reproduce and therefore are eliminated from the gene pool and therefore cease to be a problem since they don't get old enough to continue passing the gene along but it would still be present in everybody else anyway.

spicymchaggis73,1626613723,omq7fp,"Say an unmanned spacecraft went to orbit Pluto- how exactly did it get there? Is it controlled manually from the Earth (and if so- how?) or is there a built-in system that helped navigate to Pluto's orbit.

Furthermore, let's say hypothetically the spacecraft landed there and came back with samples (I don't know if this is actually feasible or not but let's just go with it), so how exactly did it do *that*? I'm sure it's insanely complicated, so any explanation will be appreciated.",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How exactly do spacecraft navigate through the solar system?,"'h5mlrrc', 'h5mls70', 'h5mlwjh', 'h5mm4j9', 'h5mpicb', 'h5ms2b4', 'h5n3da4', 'h5n6v2c', 'h5o7jff'",9,"Orbital mechanics (how objects in space move) are pretty well understood and predictable. All the planets' orbits are well-known and can be planned around, so there isn't a huge need for direct control during flight (aside from monitoring it). If something like a meteor(ite) damages the craft, it's not like it can be fixed, so it just keeps going.

Since the behavior of all the major bodies in the solar system is predictable, they can plan the entire flight beforehand. They can plan which bodies to slingshot around and what the speed/direction of the craft will be afterwards.

It's currently not feasible to get a sample from Pluto home. I believe the farthest that we've retrieved a sample so far is the Moon; all of the Mars missions have been one-way trips. The problem is that it takes a lot of fuel to get the craft out of Earth's orbit, out to Pluto, land, take off, out of Pluto's orbit, and back to Earth's, as well as a lot of time. So such a thing hasn't even been attempted.

But control of a hypothetical Pluto lander would be achieved similarly to the Mars rovers. Mostly pre-programmed operations, with some direct control from home. Due to the distance, it would take quite a while for commands/information (about 4.6 hours each way) to reach the lander, so direct, real-time control wouldn't be feasible."

The key difference about traveling in space is that there is no air which means there is no *drag.*

In a car on earth, when you apply engine force you accelerate until the drag your car experiences increases enough to counteract that acceleration and what you end up with is a new velocity.

But in space, a ship with a running engine will continue to gain speed (accelerate) constantly because there is no drag!

Even the smallest engine on the largest ship would have no limit to the speed (km/h) it could achieve.  So in this case it’s more appropriate to refer to engine power by the amount of *acceleration* it can apply to a ship, rather than velocity.

In your book’s case it’s probably defined as multiples of earth gravity (9.81m/s^2) because that is relevant to earthlings."

However you practice, it won’t sound “good” as a whole until each of those combinations sounds good. So work on one of them, and when it’s good, move onto the next one; now you have two.

CuckservativeSissy,1626563815,omeycb,Just an idea I was pondering. What is preventing workers from big corporations or any business for that matter from filing class action lawsuits against the companies they work for inadequate pay if their share of the payout of the profit is small or a fraction in comparison to the net profit being generated... Shouldn't we have a system that requires a certain level of profits from a profitable company be dedicated to the workers who helped build the business and keep the business running.... so that profits aren't disproportionally paid to the CEO or partners or board members of said corporation while workers wages are stagnated? Even in the circumstances of equity in the company... Shouldn't anyone who is part of the company earn stock if they are hired and be a part owner that is proportional to their contribution... I believe in capitalism but the way that the current system is set up it disproportionally favors the business starters over it's workers... The working class creates and maintains the wealth of the company as much as the person who starts it... I believe that if you start a business that you are entitled to a greater share if the profits but is there any legal ground that workers can explore to secure their right to just compensation if they are being underpaid? We all know that trying to get congress to write laws is impossible and that the majority of ppl we elect just keep the status quo. Is there any legal basis?,explainlikeimfive,"ELI5 Can workers from a company like ""Amazon"" or ""McDonalds"" file a class action lawsuit against the company for inadequate compensation?","'h5kg2q1', 'h5kg52n', 'h5kgp2h', 'h5khjgf', 'h5khqbs', 'h5kitam'",6,"I mean it's my fundamental view that any system...

Objects that are less dense than water will float. The weight by itself isn't the issue - it's the weight *divided by the volume of the object* that is.

Boats float because they're full of air, and the very light air offsets the density of the frame of the boat such that the total weight of both is less than the weight of the water in the region they occupy."

The sky is blue because [red light travels easily through it, but blue light bounces off the air](https://i.imgur.com/QSyIIXj.png). That makes the direct light look redder and the scattered light blue. So the sun's direct light looks orangeish (it's actually close to white) and the sky's scattered light is blue. But that's not the only way color can happen, it just happens to be the main factor in the color of the atmosphere (other factors include dust, which scatters light in a different way, and the slight innate colors of the gases in it [e.g. oxygen is very slightly blue]).

Many objects in space emit colored light. Cool stars, for example, are emitting red light to begin with (unlike the nearly white sun). Hot stars glow bluish. And other factors can disrupt the color of light, like shooting it through clouds in space (which of course aren't vacuums and scatter light for the same reason the atmosphere does)."

* Stabbing pain: There are many pain receptors on your skin and they are close together. So the ones that are damaged report pain to your brain and the ones right next to them that aren't damaged don't report pain. So you can point to the exact spot that hurts. This is sharp stabbing pain because it's like a fine knife going into your body.

* Dull ache: This is often used to describe pain on internal organs where the pain receptors are more spread out. So you can't pinpoint exactly where the damage is because one pain receptor is covering lots of area.

* Burning pain is often used to describe when the nerves themselves are damaged.

* Colicky pain is when a hollow organ squeezes over something hard. Your gut pushes food forward like when you squeeze the last bits out of a toothpaste tube. If there is a hard mass inside, you'll feel pain when it squeezes around that part then the pain goes away when the squeezing moves forward. Then it comes back at the next squeeze. The same goes if you have a hard stone in your urinary tract. 

* Radiating pain is when your brain confuses the internal organs with the parts of skin that share the same nerve. For example, the nerves that cover your heart then go on to cover your left arm. So if you have a heart attack, your brain might confuse the heart pain with left arm pain. This feels like the pain starts in your heart, but then moves out to your arm.

There are many other terms, but this gives you an idea of how specific injuries and the anatomy of nerves affect the terms we use. The actual terms aren't that important. There are hundreds of languages, but all humans experience the same types of pain. They're just helpful for doctors to try to narrow down what's going on when they first meet you."

There are many water filters that rely on charcoal to filter out small particles, but usually the water is being passed though many small grains of charcoal to maximize surface area and ensure all the water comes in close contact.

Charcoal works by being extremely porous and craggy.  Small particles in the water that come into contact with the surface of Charcol get stuck and are therefor removed from the water.

So you want every single drop of water to pass across or through as much of the surface as possible. .

So yes, Charcoal can be an effective way to filter many particles from water, but stirring with a solid charcoal stick is probably the least effective way to do it.

The Earth is in the right spot to be losing hydrogen and helium, and a bit of water vapour, although there is some randomness here and other factors, so for example, recently some oxygen was discovered on the Moon that had escaped from Earth.

Now how fast the river can flow downhill depends on how thick the river bed is. If it's broad and has virtually no resistance like rocks, bridges and so on, the river will shoot downhill. This is the current, measured in ampere. It's literally ""charges per second"". It's a speed, somehow. The resistance of the river bed is called resistance. It's measured in Ohm. 
So we have a measure of how much energy the river can produce, and how fast it can flow. This amounts in a certain power it can provide, meaning how fast can the river transfer the energy downhill to do work.

That net force is the difference between the water pressure above the block and below it. Pressure is force over area and pressure increases with depth, so there's a little bit more pressure on the bottom of the block than on the top. If that force is greater than the force pulling the object down, the object will rise. As it happens that buoyant force is simply the weight (=gravity) of the displaced water.

&amp;#x200B;

A neat alternative way of looking at it is in terms of energy ... but you have to understand a bit how energy is used in physics. Consider the block at some location and a identical volume of water somewhere above it. Gravitational potential energy is U = m·g·h. If you calculate the potential energy for both the block and that volume of water, you get some value X. If you then swap them around you get a different value, but this will be *lower* than X since the density (and hence mass and potential energy) of wood is lower.

SnuffSwag,1626506482,olzm6d,"This might sound like a dumb question but I promise I'm serious.

Yet I'm still a bit confused on how these animals even open their mouths under all that weight.. how they have an open stomach. Wouldn't that be flattened as well? The only thing I could think of is that the pressure inside their bodies maybe equalize the pressure on the outside.

Which brings me the to the last part of the question. As a part of that video, I saw that a leatherback sea turtle has a maximum diving depth of 1,280 meters. Yet just before that it mentioned that the pressure that far down is roughly equivalent to a polar bear standing on a postage stamp.

Not to be confused with the Crabs cycle, which is about crustaceans in washing machines. 

Here, have a [diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/CellRespiration.svg/1280px-CellRespiration.svg.png) for starters. 

You're a cell, and you need to produce some energy, in a form called ATP, which is like a tiny cellular battery that stores 1 ATP's worth of energy and is useful in all sorts of processes. The way you're going to produce that energy is by making use of the mitochondria, because the mitochondria contain a fantastic mechanism for converting the energy stored in NADH and FADH molecules into energy stored in ATP. This is shown in the top right corner of the diagram, called the Electron Transport Chain. The way this works is that first the NADH molecule donates its proton and its bonus high energy electron to the ELTH and I can't remember what that stands for. This is the first protein in the electron transport chain. It uses some of the energy in that electron to suck the proton up through it against the concentration gradient and store it in the Proton Chamber, a pocket between the inner and outer membrane of the mitochondria. Then, it hands the electron off to complex 2, which uses it to suck up the proton from an FADH, and then it hands it off to complex 3, which uses it to suck up *another* proton, and then finally it hands the electron, now depleted of energy, to complex 4, where it gets deposited back into the cytoplasm. 

Now, you've got a bunch of protons just hanging out in the Proton Chamber at the top of a concentration gradient, and concentration gradients store energy. If you let the protons move, they'll whizz down the gradient, shedding energy as they do this, in a similar way to how if you pick up a ball and drop it, it spontaneously moves in the direction of gravity (it has gravitational potential energy before you drop it, which is converted to kinetic energy when falling and to heat energy after it's done being kinetic energy). The last part of this chain is the ATP Synthase which is a really cool structure. It's like a turbine, but made of protein. At the bottom are three subunits that act to bind ADP and Pi (the materials used to build ATP), and in the centre of those three subunits is a rotating rod. The rod has a sticky outy bit on the end of it that pushes into one of the subunits, changing its shape to make it glue the ADP and Pi together with a bit of energy. As long as this rod is rotating, ATP will be produced. To make the rod rotate, a rotor is stuck to the top of it. This rotor has a bunch of slots on it that can each contain one proton. When a proton enters a slot, the change in electromagnetic distribution in the structure causes it to rotate one slot, opening up a new slot for a new proton to enter, and rotating the rod. At the other end, the proton, depleted of its concentration gradient energy, is ejected and stuck to another proton, an oxygen and two of the depleted electrons from complex 4 to make a water molecule. Therefore, as long as there is a good proton supply and enough oxygen to prevent a build-up of protons at the bottom of the rotor, the rotor will keep rotating and the rod will keep making ATP. 

At this point, you may be thinking ""That's all well and good, but I didn't ask about the Electron Transport Chain, I asked about the Krebs cycle"" and to that I'll respond ""Yes, but I wanted to talk about the Electron Transport Chain because it's interesting, screw you"". This is good stuff to know, cos it explains why the Krebs cycle exists. The job of the Krebs cycle is to produce the NADH and FADH that will be used by the Electron Transport Chain. Both of these are actually side-effects of the cycle itself: As the cycle works, it slowly breaks off protons and energised electrons from the substrate its operating on, which get captured by NAD and FAD molecules to make NADH and FADH molecules. 

Now what we're going to do is start at the end of the Krebs cycle, with Oxaloacetate 4. The 4 isn't actually part of it's name, it's an indication of how many carbon atoms are in the molecule. As you may have guessed, there are 4 carbon atoms in Oxaloacetate. Oxaloacetate is the end product of the Krebs cycle, and also the start of it - which is why it's a cycle and not a line. The first step is converting that Oxaloacetate into some Citrate. Citrate as shown on the diagram has 6 carbon atoms, so we need to get two more from somewhere. As it happens, there's two carbon atoms handily located in that pyruvate molecule over there that the glycolysis process has just finished making! Well, actually there's three, but we can't do shit with that third one so we'll just cut it off and use the two leftover, and hey look, we get one NADH out of doing that too! That's nice. Anyway we'll stick the two-thirds of the pyruvate left onto the oxaloacetate to make some citrate. Now we're going to carve that citrate down, bit by bit, into oxaloacetate again, freeing up some energy and protons. The oxaloacetate is kind of like a handle that the proteins of the krebs cycle use to hold onto while they carve, because it's easier than holding onto just the 2-carbon molecules. 

The next step on the diagram is to chop a carbon off that citrate to make a 5-carbon ketoglutarate. The chopped off carbon picks up some oxygen and becomes a useless carbon dioxide molecule, and the protons and electrons lost go to NADH. Then we do the same thing again, chopping off another carbon (which becomes another CO2) to make Succinate, and taking those protons and electrons into NADH. Now, as it happens, Succinate is actually higher energy than oxaloacetate, and that energy can be extracted too by cutting off some extra protons and rearranging some bits, and that's exactly what's happening when succinate is converted into fumerate and then fumerate into oxaloacetate, beginning the cycle anew.

Then they did a test with “shell suits” - a popular clothing material in the early 90’s at around the same time as cellphones started to come into vaguely common use. These were made entirely out of synthetic fibers, and formed loose fitting clothes that rustle - so were very prone to static sparks. Agitating a sample of these types of clothes when there was a lot of gas vapor ignited it quite easily.

Their hypothesis was that clothing styles and materials in popular use at the time cellphones started to become common started a few fires by sparking, but the fires were blamed on the new phone technology, because nobody expected clothing to start fires but did expect the new electric gadgets to be able to."

If you turn the electricity on and off very quickly, the magnet gets pulled back, then snaps back into position because the cone material is usually somewhat elastic. That makes a pressure wave. Send a lot of electricity to the wire and you get a strong snap. Send a teeny bit and you get a tiny snap. 

So audio equipment sends very complicated patterns of electricity through the speaker wires to pull and let go of the magnet in specific patterns. That makes the cone push and pull the air in front of it, which creates high and low pressure patterns. A sound wave! The speaker is really just trying to create the same patterns in the air that were there when the sound is recorded.

(Microphones work the opposite: it's still some cone material attached to a magnet over coils of wire. Only this time a different property of wires and magnets is used: if you move a magnet near a coil of wire, it causes electricity to flow through the wire. So a microphone uses a more sensitive cone that is pushed by the sound waves in the air, and the electrical patterns the magnet produces in the wires is recorded. Playing back those same patterns through a speaker makes the same sound! Also, in a pinch, if you plug a pair of headphones into a mic port, it kind of works. Not well. But just well enough to prove how similar microphones and speakers are.)"

In the earliest recordings in both film and audio the machines tended to be hand cranked with no escapement. People get tired and crank very slowly after a long day. A series of slow exposures or recordings, when played back at normal speed, appear and sound sped up.

When you speed up a recording everything gets shifted to a slightly higher pitch and speed. This lends a certain franticness to it.

Next is the fact that the older technologies were much less perfect than current technologies. For instance the oldest recordings were made by physically deforming a media such as a wax cylinder or wax disk. High frequencies contain more energy at a given volume because there are more peaks and troughs in that same time period of the utterance. That means the high frequencies have more impact on the physical media. Their grooves are deeper etc.

When the mechanical linkage recording was replaced with electrical linkage and the first true microphones were born it was still the energy of the voice that caused the electromotive force. So it was still the higher frequencies that were more accurately recorded.

Finally as those mechanical media aged more of the fidelity was lost at the low end. Replay of mechanical media caused where of mechanical media leaving only the deepest impressions fully accurate. And there's also sort of a weird waveform change as when a needle drops into a notch and then is forced back out that trailing edge can get worn down more than the leading edge where the needle can drop in.

The switch over to magnetic tape solved many of these problems to a good 80% or 90% but most of the amplifier circuits that used tubes had the same high-end spiking problems. They were better at preserving the low end and getting the magnetic image onto the tape, but the high end still peaks.

So when you look at the old sound power level meters you'll see there's a green range and a red range. Clicks, pops, and so-called highs could bring the needle well into the red range if you were keeping the base end at the good powerful median.

Now the wear also sort of adds the sad trombone sound from the Charlie Brown comics. That is the wave form I was speaking of where the wear is on the trailing edge adds a wah wah wah tone to the entire translated sound. This at first sounds ""warm"" and soft.

Another part of the old sounds comes from the fact that the mechanical media such as the vinyl record itself or the original wax cylinder or wax desk recording media might not have been perfectly uniform. Variations in density spot to spot on the media leads to variations of sound. This could lead to a sort of chugga chugga variation in cadence or fidelity.

So the old timey recording is a combination of inequal preservation of the lows and highs, a warmer sound to those preserved highs that speaks of some sort of distance, and then a lot of mechanical noise.

Tapes also can stretch which also warms the sound a little bit and is sort of like counter to the original speeding up effect but That's stretching is neither linear nor proportional to the original speeding up.

Also the media can get contaminated with dust and hairs and whatnot. This leads to the crackle and more pop in the playback.

And finally there's a kind of echo effect that can happen because tape is rolled on reels. For instance if you listen to ""Whole Lotta Love"" using high-quality headphones, right before he sings ""way down inside"" there's a quiet space. And if you listen carefully to that quiet space you can hear the word ""way""and maybe a little bit of ""down"" that came from magnetic transport. The very high amplitude recording of that phrase caused the original master tape to transfer that part of the recording to the silent range of tape one revolution sooner on the take-up reel.

EDIT: someone just corrected me regarding ""Whole Lotta Love"". Apparently Jimmy Page made a great technical innovation to fake a much clearer version of ""print-through"" that he called reverse echo. So that reverse echo is on purpose and not actually a tape induced error as I had long thought. (And I also just learned that the name of that noise when it happens by accident is 'print-through'. Hahaha. Live and learn. 🤘😎)

Basically we have been trained to feel that flaws in the recording are thing of the past. As has every generation before us going back to the advent of recording itself. This is because recording technologies keep getting better, so any flaw must be ""old"" compared to what we have now."

Now, without meaning to sound sarcastic, there aren't many uses for smoke. Smoke by its nature is hard to do anything with - it's already undergone one chemical reaction that releases a lot of energy, so it generally needs a lot of energy *input* to react any further.

What about storing the gases? You could do that, but you'd need a lot of storage space. Gases are very low density, so if you burn something you get a large volume of gas. Think of the size of a cloud of smoke compared to the thing that's burning. So you either need a large storage space or to compress the gas. You also need to make sure it doesn't leak.

To actually visualize gravity, we cannot really do so intuitively in 3D (hence why everyone uses the stretchy fabric). If we could see 4D objects, then we probably could have a better idea, but we can't.

The best way that i can think of is to look at an image of the orbits of planets. To us, in 3D they all look like they are going in circles. However, that is the distortion of gravity. In reality, the planets are moving in straight lines, and it is the way gravity distorts space that makes us observe the planets moving in a circle."

Having a well developed brain costs a lot of energy, and - for generational improvement - requires a lot of parental nurturing. That means you can only develop it in settings where there is ample energy, and a very useful trait is having sufficiently cohesive social structures to support the parenting, teaching, and development of the young, as well as having enough free time to develop skills and technology which apply that intelligence.

That requires a number of other traits to develop beforehand or alongside. For us there were several imporotant developments, which included (but certainly wwere not limited to):

1. Fine motor skills and physical strength to enable tool use

2. Access to higher energy foods. This was done through the control of fire, and the development of agriculture (or at least communal hunter-gathering, allowing some individuals to not need to be out exposed to the environment to feed themselves). Both are dependent on number 1.

3. Having a sufficiently cohesive social order that you can dedicate some individuals to specific tasks, while freeing up others to experiment with supporting young, developing new skills, passing those skills on to others, and so on. That is facilitated by the development of complex language (and hence feeds back into benefits of greater intelligence, and so on)

4. The physiology to allow development of larger brain cavities - birthing something with a massive head is a physiological challenge, and the fragility and skeletal requirements are not insignificant. Young gazelle and impala (and their mothers) can run within minutes of being born. They are much better addapted to surviving around lions than we are.


The costs in developing intelligence are very high, but once you have an edge the impact snowballs - it becomes a positive feedback loop where the intelligence allows further refining and honing of the environment to allow further developments. 

You can't look on intelligence as a single element that is beneficial on its own; it's not. You have to have other complimentary physical, social and environmental conditions that allow it to flourish. In a sufficiently aggressive or hostile environment intelligence becomes a burden, because immediate survival of the young to the point where they can reproduce becomes the primary driver, and the nurturing required for the other elements that fed into the development of intelligence across a species get missed out.

I'm sure there's some evolutionary biologists around who can refine this with better info, but this is the broad picture (at least as I understand it)."

3D graphics is just a bunch of data. There's no reason why you can't encode 3D graphics in a text format, and in fact we do. For instance the STL format often used in 3D printing has a text representation that looks like:
    
    solid model
    facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
    outer loop
    vertex 20.0 0.0 0.0
    vertex 0.0 -20.0 0.0

If you save that as ""j.pnm"", you should be able to view it in a program that can read the format.

It's just long and verbose, but other than that there's nothing difficult about expressing 3D data in text. And sure, you can combine different kinds of data in one file, and have markup indicating what part is what. HTML is an example of that kind of thing.

Because if it was supposed to be used then demand for that good would crash (say the gangsters wanted to buy luxury cars from the drug money) wich means the sellers of those products have to lower their prices to still get a customer.

This keeps cascading through all parts of the economy and causes some deflation (decreasing prices, increasing value of money).

Though just burning some millions won't make a huge dent, since there are trillions circulating in the economy. So the influence would likely be local and temporary unless you burn a much larger amount.

[12GB (Medium bitrate)](https://i.imgur.com/9P7Ir8g.png)

[35GB (High bitrate)](https://i.imgur.com/Xw5dSsr.png)

All of these are technically 1080p but the the smallest one looks awful because there's just not enough data to encode a clean image.

The middle one is pretty close to how streaming services look (nowadays they're smaller filesizes but use newer more efficient compression algorithms - I took the screenshots at least 5 years ago).

Still the middle one is not as detailed as the biggest one which should be nearly identical to true blu-ray quality. The difference might not be as noticeable on smaller screes, especially with movement, but the bigger the screen the more apparent it will be.

So to answer the question - blu-ray movies are big to give the viewer the highest possible quality, it wouldn't make sense to make the movie smaller and more compressed if the disk can fit more anyway.

But some (actually most, judging by the supply and demand) people prefer convenience over quality so they go for the awful looking versions just so they can see the movie - so that's why the lower quality versions exist.

Edit: just a heads up, if you're trying to compare these on a phone you might not see much of a difference - that was actually a big problem people had last time I posted this comparison."

But the water draining away isn’t what causes a drought, all water drains like this. 

What causes droughts is there isn’t enough rainfall/snowfall REPLACING the water that drains away. Low precipitation means there just isn’t as much water replenishing the land as there normally is. This is caused by a bunch of different weather phenomena, and is believed that climate change is causing events like droughts to become more common/severe."

Mathematicians also like to divide themselves into two camps: [the Algebraists and the Analysts](http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2010/08/analysis-vs-algebra-predicts-eating.html). The algebraists like symbolic manipulation, and the analysts like limits (as in calculus).

Cost push is inflation that is caused when the cost of goods increases and those increases can't be absorbed by the companies producing the goods.  The cost is ""pushed"" up by the increase material costs.

Demand pull is what you are talking about.  People are looking to consume more, so they try to buy more of the available amount of goods.  This increase in demand means that suppliers can charge more and still sell the same amount of product (which is easier than charging the same price and selling more).  Increased consumption 'pulls' prices higher.  Demand pull is pretty constant across every society, as societies tend to get more prosperous and populated over time, so there is almost always a slow and steady increase in demand over time.

Contrary to what people will tell you, a little bit of inflation is actually a very good thing.  It helps incentivize people to buy things now rather than wait (which is critical to keeping an economy moving), it punishes stagnant money (encouraging investment), and it helps make debt easier to pay over time (as debt is static, but your wage goes up making that debt a smaller % of your income).  Most of all, it serves as a guard against _deflation_, which will straight up kill an economy - if money becomes more valuable over time, all three of the things I mentioned above are reversed, and each of those are really, really bad when reversed.

Of course, too much inflation is really bad too. That is why most modern economies target 2-3% annual inflation, on average.  This year is a bit of an aberration, as inflation was basically zero last year so we are rebounding this year, leading to inflation a bit above average."

You can have the recessive allele i (protein deficient) or varieties A or B of the dominant allele I.

So you're right, it depends on the gene. Codominant alleles can only exist for genes where it's biologically viable to have a protein product that is altered, but still fulfills its function -- like the A and B antigens in ABO. B looks different from A but still acts as a recognition marker. And as you say, this could arise randomly as long as these conditions are met and evolution doesn't weed it out."

Depends on how you define improved, and *who* it's improved for.

Let's take a neighborhood that was historically Black or Latino, where primary incomes are from service jobs like restaurant cook, housecleaning, grocery store clerk, fast food service, day care worker, home health aide, or custodial services. They're working long hours and earning near minimum wage. (Society needs these 'essential' workers, but they don't get paid much.) Their community may seem ""dumpy"" because they don't have the resources or leisure time to improve the curb appeal of their home, and, importantly, the city hasn't done much to improve the area either. However, families have been there for 40+ years and the community is strong. Everybody knows everyone's families. 

Property values rise. 

- **Taxes rise.** With some of these homes that have been owned for many decades, the only cost to the owners is taxes and upkeep. If property taxes double, this can be a significant burden. 

- **Upkeep costs rise.** Both in terms of time and money; it's more expensive to keep up with the neighborhood vibe. Painting the house goes from long term nice to have, to immediate *should probably*. 

- **Insurance costs rise.** This is also a biggie. If your house is worth more, and you have to carry insurance, the insurance becomes more expensive.

- **Local businesses change and become expensive.** The cheap supermarket may close, forced out due to rising rent. The barber shop, the pizza shop, the hardware store in walking distance, the convenience store, the meat shop. Suddenly instead of your necessities, there's a kombucha bar, a blowout salon, a dog groomer. Sure, they're *nice*, but they're not what you need. A new grocery store opens within driving distance, but you don't have a car, and the prices there are high. 

- **Long established families cash out.** They sell to flippers. Or the matriarch dies and the family can't afford to keep the house. Renters can't continue staying there after the owner sells to an investor. Your neighbors are disappearing... and the social fabric is fraying. 

- **Less crime?** Maybe. The teenagers aren't being hassled by cops, but there's no one watching out for them either from their porches. White families put up security cameras for 'safety'. It's no longer okay for kids to play in the street.

The streets look less ""dumpy"" but everything is more expensive, and the community that had been there for almost half a century is forced out because their incomes don't keep up."

According to special(?) relativity, nothing that carries information can travel faster than the speed of light. This seems to include changes in any force fields.

Planets far away from the sun at the time of disappearing would continue to feel the sun's gravity for a short time because their region of spacetime would still be curved (until the “wave” hits them).

Physiological explanation can be based on hormones levels. Pregnancy put your hormonal system all over the place with oestrogen and progesterone levels going through the roof but suddenly collapsing after the birth. It can be one of the leading cause, but not always, some persons are more sensible to hormonal changes and while all women go through this brutal transition after birth, not all of them will experience PPD.

The social explanation can be based on what you expect vs reality. I'm not a sociologist tho, but I feel like there is a huge idealisation of the pregnancy/maternity in our society where women are all super happy to get pregnant, see their belly grow, care for the baby and all when in reality it can be pretty brutal to see your body change to a point where you can't really recognize it, it's also exhausting to be pregnant and you have nasty side effects that no one will tell you about because it's taboo, a lot of women actually really don't like being pregnant but they don't talk about it because if you do you're seen as a bad mom.

A birth can be very traumatic psychologically as well. And for some the ""it became magic when they put the baby on me after the birth, I immediatly fell in love with my baby and felt like amom"" don't happen. It's okay though, it can takes to love your baby and talking about it with someone can really help. But again, pregnancy and maternity being seen as a magical period, not a lot of women talk about it."

As the food slides down your throat, food that's gone bad will release chemicals that can damage the cells lining your esophagus, that will signal your brain and cause you to gag and could expel bad food.

Basically, the drug manufacturer sets a price on the finished product based on the cost of ingredients, cost of development (research/patent costs) and the cost of manufacturing. 
Some more info: when a new drug is developed a company will purchase a patent on the formula to ensure they have sole rights to manufacture and distribute, thereby monopolizing sales and guaranteeing profit. At this point they can set the price as high as they want because they are the only ones making it. In North America, these patents last 20 years. Once they expire, other companies can purchase the formula and being manufacturing. These secondary companies typically undercut the price by about half to guarantee profit by volume of sales.

A leaf must find the balance between two things: 

1. A leaf must ""capture"" sunlight for photosynthesis 

2. A leaf must take in carbon dioxide from the surrounding air via pores.

The leaf, then, is affected by these balancing acts: enough sunlight and carbon dioxide to run photosynthesis, but not too much associated heat absorption or water loss.

Leaves high in the tree canopy receive a great deal of sunlight. These leaves tend to be smaller in size (and, therefore, have reduced light absorptive surface area) and tend also to have complex edges and lobes (which enables them to disperse absorbed heat very rapidly). Leaves in the lower tree canopy are more shaded. These lower canopy leaves tend to be larger (more light absorptive surface area) and tend to have reduced expressions of lobes and edges. 

These trends may be observed in comparing the leaves of high canopy trees (like oaks) to the leaves of low canopy trees (like dogwoods), or they can also be observed in an individual tree that has leaves in both the upper and lower canopies (the white oak, for example). In the white oak the smaller upper canopy leaves are also noted to allow significant amounts of light to pass through the upper canopy in order to keep the lower leaves supplied with sufficient light to allow their continued photosynthesis. 

Needle-shaped leaves have a very low light absorptive surface area. Each needle, then, is not able to capture very much sunlight energy for photosynthesis. Needles also have a very thick, outer cuticle coating and special ""pit-like"" pores designed to prevent excessive water loss. Trees with needle-shaped leaves are especially well suited to sites that have drier soils and to climates in which the careful conservation of water is an important survival strategy."

I don't understand why shouting is considered *inherently* bad. Like, in almost every situation it is frowned upon. For example, my sister dismisses anything I say when I yell or raise my voice in an argument, even if it's important. She says it's childish and immature to shout. She says that shouting is only something children do, and we're adults now. I've been lying in bed thinking about it, and I've realised that I genuinely don't understand it.

I feel like shouting is a natural physical reaction to anger. Just like laughing is to joy, and crying is to sadness. Of course you shouldn't laugh or cry in all situations, but they aren't seen as inherently bad the way shouting is.

It seems like adults are only excused from yelling when they have been gravely and extremely wronged, but that makes no sense to me.

Its not about a world government. Its about comnecting different parts of the world.

Shipping and air travel has made transporting things from different countries much easier. The internet and satellites has made worldwide communication instant. International organisations has made communication between countries more streamlined.

thats what globalism is.

A car manufactured in germany, made out of parts assembled in in china, from ore mined in south america, transported by vehicles that run on gas from the middle east, is an example of globalism.

Nationalism would be something along the lines of;
Car manufactured in germany, from ore mined in germany, from parts assembled in germany, from german companies.

And that may sound good. But this means Germany doesnt get access to superior designs from other countries. Or they lack access to materials that are superior. For example Copper. The vast majority of the worlds copper is mined in Chile, because thats where most of the copper is located. So if germany refused to import copper, their products would suffer. They would get more expensive, and they would contain less copper.

Globalism is about international cooperation and dependance. Without it, we wouldnt have an internet. Or coconuts in northern europe. The reason we have all this technology, is because we depend on others to produce it. While we produce things other countries depends on.

One country mines the iron, and coal. Another country manufactures the cars that drive that stuff. Country three refines the ore inte metals. Country 4 buys that metal and makes parts out of it, and then country 1 may buy it back and make the cellphones.

So now country 1 has access to the materials to make a cellphone, even though country 1 never refined the ore, or made the parts itself. This also means that tiny countries, can get access to high quality material, and make high quality stuff, even though those small countries cant mine the material themselves.

Business usually doesn't work well if you insult your clients. Are they morally in the right for disliking tattoos? I don't think so. Is it worth ensuring you don't offend clients whose money you are trying to get? I would think so, from a business perspective. Business is not the domain of social progress.

Graphic tees are usually uncommon in a professional setting. They can be distracting and possibly make someone dislike the encounter based on the content, vs a ""safe"" neutral shirt. Tattoos are like a graphic tee you can never change out of.

You are looking for a moral argument about social standards being arbitrary, but that's not where the issue is. The issue is that the standards *exist*, and business must take that into account as a practical reality, if the intention is to make money.

Sometimes they are not opposed: it's fine to wear a graphic tee and have tattoos if you work at Hot Topic, because that has a positive effect on the clientele instead of negative. It's not a moral approach there either. It's just what makes money."

The train analogy is a bit of ""common knowledge"" that doesn't actually reflect physics.

As it turns out; it doesn't matter how fast you're going or what direction you're moving in. Light (in a vacuum) always propagates at **precisely** c, no more, no less. There's an [*extremely* famous experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment) that actually proved this to be true.

Edit: on the train analogy; say you're on a train (moving X mph) and you fire a gun in the same direction as the train is moving (with a muzzle velocity of Y mph). At the same moment you fire the gun, you pass a person standing on the ground outside the train. Both of you now observe the bullet traveling in the same direction as the train.

You observe the bullet to be traveling at Y mph (relative to you), and the outside observer observes you traveling at X mph relative to themselves, but they do *not* see the bullet travel at X+Y mph relative to themselves; instead, the bullets actual speed, relative to that stationary observer, is strictly less than X+Y, regardless of the velocities involved, and the faster and faster all of this occurs, the less and less adding the velocities is permissible and the more error is introduced. At the most extreme case (i.e. the bullet is fired at the speed of light), both you *and* the stationary observer see the bullet travel at precisely the same speed; c."

On land, therefore, armies could pretty much move as fast as a person could march, and even then not for very long. 

Without modern agriculture, there also weren't massive stores of food available, other than in cities and towns. Other than what a soldier could carry and supplies could be carted, armies had to pretty much stick to pretty flat land - a mountain range with no passes was pretty much insurmountable for any army of the time. This means that it pretty much wasn't much of a mystery which routes armies could or would take. 

Because of the weapons (like muskets) one of the most effective ways to fight was to spread out infantry in a line. Given the limitations of weapons and carrying capacity, there weren't really things like sustained engagements - things were settled pretty quickly - one party advanced and the other retreated. There is a frontline although it probably wasn't until WW1 that trench warfare really took hold and that didn't carry through to WW2 when mechanization made trench warfare less effective. 

Modern warfare is much different. Mechanized vehicles, information gathering technology and air support means that military strategists can adopt many different battle tactics. There is no dominant battle tactic for a modern army - everything is adapted to the situation."

Yes, according to the etymology ""bi-"" refers to ""two"" and ""pan-"" means ""all"", but bisexuality was never intended as affirming only the existence of two genders or excluding attraction to trans and non-binary individuals. It just refers to being attracted to more than one gender.

As you can read in the [Bisexual Manifesto from 1990](https://bimanifesto.carrd.co/#manifesto):
""Bisexuality is a whole, fluid identity. Do not assume that bisexuality is binary or dougamous in nature; that we must have ""two"" sides or that we MUST be involved simultaneously with both genders to be fulfilled human beings. In fact, don't assume that there are only two genders.""

The distinction according to which bisexuals are only attracted to specific genders/genitals and pansexuals don't care about gender is based on wrong assumptions about bisexuality. In general, there is a lot of overlap between bisexuality and pansexuality, in terms of being attracted to more than one/all genders.

The fact that the 2 are opposites is a surprising fact at first indeed, but once we know that it allows a lot of calculus to work, which is why it is fundamental.

It's hard to see why this is true if you visualize them as just graph.  But it's much more obvious if you think of derivative as rate of change. Derivative doesn't just give the slope of the tangent, it also gives rate of change.

You should use a different mental model, don't stick to just 1 model. Function isn't a graph, a graph is just a mental model for function. Derivative isn't a slope, it's just a mental model for derivative. Integration isn't area under the curve, it's just a mental model for integration.

The conceptual link is a lot clearer if you think this way: slope of tangent = rate of change = infinitesimal increase in area.

Slope of tangent being equal the rate of change just come directly from the definition of what is a ""tangent line"".

The precise statement of (one-half of) the fundamental theorem of calculus is this:

- Let f is a continuous function defined on an interval, t a number in that interval, F is a function defined as: F(x) is the integral of f from t to x. Then F is differentiable and F'(x)=f(x).

So remember, think rate of change. Don't just graph out F and think about its slope. Think of F as how much paint you need to keep painting the area under f, as you move from left to right. The derivative of F would be the rate of paint consumption. Visualize it this way, things should be obvious."

ipp0n,1626122349,oizwbn,"&gt; Building on the work of Felix Hausdorff, in 1924 Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski proved that given a solid ball in 3‑dimensional space, there exists a decomposition of the ball into a finite number of disjoint subsets that can be reassembled together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original ball. Banach and Tarski proved that, using isometric transformations, the result of taking apart and reassembling a two-dimensional figure would necessarily have the same area as the original. This would make creating two unit squares out of one impossible. But in a 1929 paper, **von Neumann proved that paradoxical decompositions could use a group of transformations that include as a subgroup a free group with two generators. The group of area-preserving transformations contains such subgroups, and this opens the possibility of performing paradoxical decompositions using these subgroups.** The class of groups von Neumann isolated in his work on Banach–Tarski decompositions was very important in many areas of mathematics, including von Neumann's own later work in measure theory.",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: Von Neumann paradox,"'h4ypo6e', 'h4ysnz7', 'h4zc4u5', 'h4zs4jy', 'h4zzo9z', 'h50f1ma', 'h50fd55'",7,"First of all, it isn't actually a paradox, *per se*. It's a true theorem with a seemingly paradoxical result.

It relies on ~~two~~ three things (I originally didn't include S-B as ""one of the things""):

1. All intervals of finite length on the real number line have identical cardinality (that is, there are as many points between 0 and 1 as there are between 0 and 2)

2. There's something called the ""Axiom of Choice"", which allows us to pick individual points in a specified manner even out of infinite sets.

3. There's something called the Schröder–Bernstein theorem which means that if you have a map sending every element of set A to an element of set B, and every element of set B to every element of set ~~B~~ **A**, you can set up a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of A and B.

Basically, the system goes like this:

* Take a square
* Pick half of the points in a very specific way
* Move and stretch them in 2D using a specific method so that they cover the same area as the original square
* We define a new map in some specific way making a correspondence between the points of the new copy and the points of the old copy
* S-B means that we now have a one-to-one correspondence between the two copies, which means they're the same size

The ""paradox"" comes primarily from the fact that all intervals on the real line have the same cardinality.

Let's address the part you highlighted:

&gt;von Neumann proved that paradoxical decompositions could use a group of transformations that include as a subgroup a free group with two generators. The group of area-preserving transformations contains such subgroups, and this opens the possibility of performing paradoxical decompositions using these subgroups.

The short version is that this method allows us to choose our sets of points. Basically, using a free group allows us to pick a set of points and reliably know that we can apply the same transform to them to map them to another set of points that we know. The use of two generators is involved in developing the backwards map needed to invoke S-B.

If not, then no this behaviour will not be contributing to you having insomnia.

The most critical thing to maintain a regular circadian rhythm and beat insomnia isn't to force yourself to sleep, but is to wake up at the same time every day. Do this without fail. After a few weeks (or if you're lucky, days) you will find that the time that you go to sleep will naturally find a regular time allowing you to get sufficient sleep. 

Of course you should avoid screens from 9 hours before your scheduled wake-up time. This isn't just about brightness of the screen, but also about interactive stimulation. Every time there is something unexpected your brain triggers a dopamine release which increases alertness. Every time you need to make a choice this also triggers dopamine and increases alertness. If you're clicking on things to get unexpected results (like seeing the comments below some social media post) you're triggering both kinds of stimulation.

Do read a book with a dim light."

Languages have different rhythm, affecting musical rhythm. Sometimes it's useful to write lyrics in Spanish, sometimes in French, sometimes in Bengali.

Languages encode so much of what it means to have a perspective on the world. That diversity is irreplaceable.

I've seen viral videos where, for instance, a group of people may feel pity for an individual, for instance, because he does not have a car and has to walk to work every day, so they get together and buy him a car. If it wasn't for pity, then that wouldn't have happened. Right? So, why is pity looked down upon? Pity is the sharing and understanding of another's emotions.

What's ""their"" axioms here? There are no ownership relationship between a true statement and axioms. What's the axioms of ""there are no biggest natural number""?

That statement about Godel theorem is too imprecise to even say where your misunderstanding happen. My guess here is that you think it said that there exist some true claims, and there exist some axioms (called ""their"" axioms), such that the true claims cannot be proved from these axioms. If that's what you thought it said, then yeah the theorem sound trivial.

The actual Godel theorem said that *any* consistent, enumerable set of axioms that interpret Peano's arithmetic will never be sufficient to *prove* or *disprove* every claims.

The theorem talk about *any* set of axioms with the above property. It's easy to intentionally invent a set of axioms that is just bad; but the point is that this is a fundamental limitation that you cannot fix even if you try.

It's also important to notice the order of quantifier: for any set of axioms then there exist some statements. The set of true claims that cannot be proved is not a fixed set independent of the axioms. Each set of axioms will have different set of unprovable true claims.

Not the most important misunderstanding, but still, you need to consider everything the axioms can prove or disprove. Sure, D might not be listed among A,B,C but depends on what A,B,C are, you might still be able to prove D from it.

All of the conditions in the theorems (consistent, enumerable, interpret Peano arithmetic) are important. You *can* have a set of axioms that let you prove everything if your axioms include contradictions (not consistent). You can have a set of axiom that let you prove all true claims if your axioms are not enumerable. You can have a set of axioms that let you prove or disprove every claims if you just give up on interpreting Peano's arithmetic; in fact we do actually use these. This makes a vague summary like ""there are (true) theorems in math that cannot be proven formally from their axioms"" very misleading."

It takes a moment for your blood pressure and heart rate to correct for this change in blood distribution. Once your heart picks up again, it corrects for the low BP in your head, and your vision returns to normal.

Just as an experiment, before you hop out of bed next time, move your arms and legs around a bit before you do so. Really flex your leg muscles and get your heart moving a bit faster. I'd wager the effect is nonexistent, or at least less pronounced.

100g carbs in a soda will hit you bloodstream almost instantly, spiking your blood sugar, which will cause your body to produce a lot of insulin to deal with it. 

The difference is how long it takes your body to get the carbs out of the food.

As well, if the goal is to eat less calories, drinking a soda will add calories without actually making you feel like you've eaten. As well it can make you crave more carbs when your blood sugar drops back down.

So carbs and calories that make you feel full and are released slowly are better in that sense.

First and most obviously, diesel engines tend to run at a lower speed. That fact will lend them a less smooth sound as each combustion event can be heard more distinctly rather than blending into an overall drone.

Secondly, the combustion process. Diesel engines are CI. That means that you tend to get lots of fuel droplets within the combustion volume that will ignite nearly simultaneously, causing a pressure wave that will ignite the surrounding area. This would cause a swifter/more violent combustion event than the smooth outward progression you get from the spark plugs in an SI engine.

Thirdly. CI engines run at a higher compression ratio than SI engines so they will more actively expel exhaust from the cylinder. This is because the amount of volume left in the cylinder with the piston at TDC in relation to the volume in the cylinder with the piston at BDC on smaller.

As I said, I'm no expert but I think these are likely the main causes."

There's something called the rock cycle, in which rocks change form due to different geological processes, including melting.

Igneous rocks = rocks that are formed when magma or lava cools and solidifies. e.g. granite, basalt, obsidian.

Metaphoric rocks = rocks that are transformed from one type of rock into another due to conditions like high pressure or heat -- not enough to melt, but enough to change crystal structures. e.g. gneiss, shale, slate.

Sedimentary rocks = rocks that are formed by the consolidation of sediment, like silt or sand. ion-heavy water flows between the grains and deposits new minerals, solidifying the structure into a new solid rock. e.g. sandstone, limestone, shale.

The sediment could have either biologic origins, such as mud, or geologic origins, such as wind and water eroding existing rocks.

Existing rocks are pushed underground by plate tectonics, which cause them to melt into magma once deep enough. Then, they can rise back up through the crust and solidify embedded there, or escape to the surface through a volcano and solidify there.

All rocks are made of combinations of minerals, and they can shift from type to type, into new kinds of rocks, due to the processes above.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: To expand on where the minerals that make up rocks came from in the first place:

The solar system was formed from a cloud of gas and dust. Lots of it, namely hydrogen, coalesced into the sun, but lots of it remained in orbit around the sun and coalesced into planets (and moons and asteroids). The heavy (mainly heavier than hydrogen and helium) elements that make up rock minerals were formed either in the late life stages of prior stars' lives, or when they exploded in supernovae."

Here is why we see it blue.
The white light that the sun emits, actually contains all colors of light. Our brains have simply adapted to see the combination of all colors as white.

Different colors of light have different wavelengths.
And because our atmosphere has density, compared to the vacuum of space, when the light from the sun reaches it, it refracts (scatters in a random direction basically).

Because of the specific wavelength that blue light has, it tends to refract easier than other colors of light.

That is why we see the sky as being blue.
Same goes for people with blue eyes."

Since our skin and hair are self-oiling this is obviously helpful in washing away the old oil and the grime that gets stuck in it.

But washing away all the skin and hair oils isn't good, it makes them dry and fragile. So we want to add a little bit of good oil back after cleaning off the grimy stuff, and that is what conditioner is. Essentially it is fresh clean oil for your hair.

What happens if you mix them together? Well, they both get worse at doing what they are supposed to do.

But, sometimes the companies that you have accounts with don’t do a great job of keeping your password secret. And if one of them messes up, now the password for all of your accounts isn’t a secret anymore!

Most people will make up passwords that aren’t very strong either, because weak passwords are usually easier to remember. If you use your birthday or the name of a family member, these passwords aren’t very hard to guess, especially for a computer who can make lots of guesses very quickly

A password manager helps you to fix both of these problems. With a password manager you can come up new strong passwords that are different for each account you have and you don’t have to worry about remembering them. So you can have a password that looks like this: `!DzWifTKNkrNJN$&amp;Y5M%` for one website and this `HXf^N52S5S@up*@L9Z8!` for another website

The only password you need to remember is for your password manager. And luckily there is a neat trick to have a password that is easy to remember but still pretty hard to guess. It’s called Dice Word and it looks like this: `flyable-bootie-overrule-boots-easing`

Also, you can use 2 factor authentication to keep your password manager secure, which is a fancy way of saying that in addition to your password, you also need to have access to something you own to log in like your phone or a special USB key

Keep in mind that pipeline issue wasn't an attack on the pipeline itself, it was an attack on the billing and administrative systems of the pipeline company--it was more like a shop shutting down for a bit because all it's cash registers and payment terminals are broken--they could find a way to operate, I guess, but it's easier not to until it's all fixed.

More directly, you have a monitoring problem. Anything like that is going to have a lot of devices reporting status and alarm situations back to some sort of central network monitoring center that monitors alarms and can do some things remotely. Even before COVID, but particularly with COVID, you need some way for people at home or otherwise in non-company locations to access, and thus you now have an internet connection.

And then you have the problems with parallel networks that probably shouldn't be able to cross-communicate but can due to a design error somewhere. The Target hack, for example, was because the building's AC monitoring system was hacked, and once the hackers got in there, they were able to find their way over to the billing systems. There's also the famous report of a Casino where there was an aquarium thermometer that had internet access because an external company maintained the tank, that thermometer got compromised, from there the hackers found some other device or server that could be exploited, etc, until they got their way to financial information for casino high rollers.

This kind of stuff is easy to say ""they shouldn't do that,"" but also often sufficiently complex that one engineer making a mistake can cause a problem."

You don't hear very many news stories about stretched of highway where there were no accidents, or neighborhoods where there were no house fires, etc.

Now, humans do actually have a relatively difficult time giving birth. This is because there are two major competing factors in human evolution, the benefits of being able to walk upright which favors a narrow pelvis, and the ability to think and use tools which favors a large brain.

But, the brain goes inside a skull which must pass through the pelvis at birth! So these two factors are at odds with each other, and something has to give. Human children are born relatively undeveloped and grow up outside the womb, increasing their head size after having passed the pelvis challenge. Things are still pushed to the limit though, making human birth as painful and dangerous as can be offset by the other benefits."

When we find ourselves in a situation of extreme danger our body changes very drastically very quickly, we get twhat’s called a “tunnel vision”, blood flow to the muscles is increased, pain receptors are inhibited, senses like hearing, touch, smell are enhanced, heart rate and respiratory rate are increased.

The body also releases adrenaline in “normal” situations, not just dangerous ones. Adrenaline can be an emotional response to various stimuli, pr simply generate overexcitement (what kids these days call “turnt up”), but it is also released during physical exercise to enhance our physical performance. So, shortly, there isn’t a determined reason to release adrenaline, generally its closely related to physical activities but it is also plays a large role in emotional responses. 

To answer the last question, it depends what you mean by “release it on command”, because technically when we do physical excercise adrenaline is released and we know this is what is going to happen, but we don’t have control over it… is it still “releasing on command”? In case you mean simply just thinking about it and you get an adrenaline rush then… the answer is no. This is one of the many things that are controlled by our brain automatically, subconsciously, based on the situation we find ourselves in, on the stimuli we recieve from the world. At the end of the day we are dependent on our senses, and since our senses can be tricked, a way to release adrenaline on command could be the use of drugs, or maybe even the assumption of lab-made adrenaline."

Text messages, the first kind of instant message of the modern era, was sent along telephone lines inside things called packets that were already being used. As it happens, these packets weren't using all of their potential space, so for each packet there was a little bit going unused - enough to store the information of a short text message. Messages longer than that extra packet space however would not fit, and would need to be delivered across two or more packets. 

Technical limitations today do still represent a problem that can occur, as there's still fundamentally limits to available line capacity. However, it's not always the main thing on the mind of companies anymore. Sometimes, there are other business-related reasons to limit message length. Twitter is the most famous example of this. It uses its small message limit because small limits mean no space to explain your messages - it encourages tweets to be made shorter, snappier and less clear. This fills twitter with ambiguity and punchiness, which is excellent for making your users ""engaged"" - it's a lot harder to have stupid arguments if people are given the space to properly explain themselves. This is good for Twitter because when Twitter users are having stupid arguments they wouldn't actually have if they talked face to face, Twitter makes money.

This is the case in many viruses that have doublestranded RNA as their genome.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-stranded_RNA_viruses

Additionally, it also sort of happens in humans. It's not exactly a double-strand but complementary bases can cause the RNA to fold into non-linear shapes. This is integral for the function of certain RNAs, most notably tRNA, the things that match up the codons on mRNA with the associated aminoacid during translation:

https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/transfer-rna-trna-108126017.jpg

Scroll lock is another key that exists almost solely for navigation of spreadsheets.  If you are in Excel and you turn on ScrollLock you can use the arrow keys to move the screen without losing the cell that you're in so you can pan up and right to see columns/rows you may be missing but still be able to type in your selected cell.

So your next thought is, why do we need keys for this?  You can clearly just use the mouse to move around or click on the cell you want

Adding downforce means the tires can develop more grip because they're being pushed down into the ground. That means the car can corner at higher speeds.

If you have a 2000 lb car and another 2000 lb of aerodynamic downforce, that means the aero is roughly doubling the amount of grip from the tires.

If instead you have a 2000 lb car and you add another 2000 lb of weight to it, you also have twice the amount of tire grip, but you also need twice as much grip because the car's weight has doubled. So you can't corner any faster than the original 2000 lb car without any aero.

Aerodynamic downforce gives you more grip without the disadvantage of having to get more mass around a corner. In other words, you get the tire grip of a 4000 lb car in a 2000 lb car."

Now one may extend the above logic and ask - Can children have thoughts (even though they dont know ""our"" language) - I do not know. Maybe they have - maybe they dont. For adults though - I think that thought is purely a function of language.  

Science says that ""many neurons fire in some sequence"" and a thought gets created. I believe that, given the intangible nature of thoughts,  science falls short of understanding the real genesis of thoughts. If I were to accept science's interpretation - my question would be ""who determines the sequence of firing and why is it not totally random""? And science falls short of answering that.

I believe, the answer to this question **may be found** if we were to approach it laterally. If we go through most of the age old spiritual texts (across almost all cultures )- all of them talk about a ""consciousness"" or ""spirit"" or ""god"" which exists within all living beings and is considered to be responsible for ""life"" in general (and may be considered as the source of all thoughts).

It's kind of the other way around-- the battery provides electricity for the engine to start. Gas and air are pumped into the engine's cylinders (basically small chambers sealed with a moving piston on one end) and then the piston moves to compress that gas/air mixture. Then the spark plug shoots a spark through that mixture, which causes it to explode, forcing the piston down.

The pistons are connected to a series of parts that convert that up-and-down movement into a rotating shaft. Ultimately that shaft connects to the drive wheels, which turn and make the car move. *There's also something called the differential involved but I'm trying to keep it focused here.

Getting back to the battery, once the engine's running it mostly keeps itself going, but sends a little rotational energy back to the ""alternator"" which is an electric generator. That makes sure the battery stays charged and helps run all the car's electrical systems.

Different types of income are taxed at different rates.

Ordinary income, like you get from wages, are taxed at 10% (Up to $9,950), 12% ($9,951 to $40,525), 22% ($40,526 to $86,375), 24% ($86,376 to $164,925), 32%	($164,926 to $209,425), 35% ($209,426 to $523,600), and 37% ($523,601 or more). You can see that wealthier people are taxed at a much higher rate on ordinary income than regular people.

Most billionaires aren't making most of their money through wages though, but through investments. If these investments are held for more than a year they are taxed as Long Term Capital Gains. The highest rate for Capital Gains is 20%, or less than the tax rate on wages for someone making $41k/yr. Why is it so low? Well raising the rate would hurt small time investors as well, and the economy as a whole grows when more people are investing.

Now often you hear people bring up Bezos' and Musk's increase in net worth and ask why they aren't paying taxes on it. That is because they haven't sold those investments yet even though they increased in value (referred to as unrealized capital gains). You can't pay taxes with stock: it needs to be turned into cash first. Imagine if the government did require taxes to be paid on unrealized capital gains. A couple's house might increase by $50k one year and unless they have thousands in the bank what are they supposed to do? Sell the house to pay the taxes? The situation is even worse for stock as selling a lot at one time makes the price go down. Also, Musk was the richest man in the world for a while but then his stock dropped again. If he's already paid taxes on that unrealized gain what happens? Does the government give him money back? The only thing that makes sense is to pay taxes when the stock is sold.

There are tricks people use to avoid paying taxes, but most of the reasons behind the different effective tax rate of billionaires and regular people is explained by understanding how ordinary income and capital gains are taxed."

- Amplitude. How much the wave varies from high to low.  
- Frequency. How often the wave repeats.  
- Phase. How much the start of the wave is offset from time 0.

You can sum up any number of different fundamental waves to get a composite signal. You can also de-construct that composite signal into its component waves.

Now, we want to encode a message into our wave. The way we do this is by varying one or more of the amplitude, frequency or phase of the wave.

For example, the most basic form of modulation is Amplitude Modulation - the basis of AM radio. This is an analog system where the changing amplitude of our wave can be read as another wave - a wave that encodes the information we want.

Most modern communications is built off of variations of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation, where you use fixed variations of frequency/amplitude/phase to encode digital values (4 in the case of 'Quadrature', although more complex systems exist)."

Yes, absolutely. Certain immunizations can even cause a fever -- the body can't know what's good and what's bad, so it sounds the alarm regardless.

&gt;does a fever ‘know’ when it has done its job in the body (killing bad stuff)

Yes, in fact. A fever is *caused* by whatever ""bad"" stuff has gotten into you triggering your immune system to tell your brain to heat up your body.

Earth - we’ve got plenty of gravity. Plus a nice big magnetic field that keeps the radiation from the sun from carrying out atmosphere away.  

Mars - very thin atmosphere, mostly of carbon dioxide.  Mars can’t keep an atmosphere because of low gravity and no magnetic field to keep the solar wind from stripping it away.  Mars does have enough of an atmosphere for the little helicopter from the most recent rover to fly around a bit.

You can gain SOME strength without size, but this is limited. When you first start training, your brain has to readjust. You’ve probably never fully utilized a muscle before.

Once your nervous system gets better at using what it already has, it will start to ask for more. The only way to get more, is to add muscle. There are no huge body builders that are weak, and no super strong guys that are small. As you get bigger, you get stronger, and vice versa. 

You can prioritize size or strength by using different rep ranges, but if you are working hard, you’ll get both. 

Now, let’s talk about muscle gain. It IS slow. Very slow. Most of the body builders you see are late 30s. A non-steroid using body can synthesize about one ounce of muscle per day. This is if everything is perfect… food intake, exercise, rest, etc. so you can gain, at most 1 pound of muscle every two weeks or so. But this is only the first year you start training.

azamatdev,1625851813,oh0f19,"Let me clarify. I heard that publicly traded companies are obliged to provide growth to its shareholders. In case they purposefully do something that doesn't provide growth (e.g. increase salaries, when in fact, they could get away with lower salaries), shareholders can sue them. It means that companies are forced to pay as low as possible to increase profits and stay afloat. 

You might say that shoudn't offer IPO in the first place to avoid that. Even if that's the case, the current system incentivizes this behavior. If we have two companies that provide near identical products/services, the one that cuts corners will always win. In other words, good people go, incentives always stay. It's nearly impossible to succeed in this system without screwing the workers as much as possible. 

You might say that new competitors with more attractive salaries will appear, but that's far from the truth. Some markets are difficult to penetrate due to production costs and monopoly/duopoly.

So even if raising salaries increased cost, that's not necessarily some sort of breach of responsibility that shareholders could sue for. If it was, then every single person in every public company everywhere would only ever make minimum wage with no raises ever.

The second issue is the idea that raising salaries necessary increases costs. Alexander Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies, made $1B (yes, that is a B as in BILLION) in compensation in 2019.

Palantir has 2,500 employees. He could give everyone a $200k raise and still have HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR HIMSELF without directly affecting shareholder profits."

Either it is reflected, or it is absorbed. Anyone familiar with mechanics can probably already guess where this is going.

Light that is absorbed transfers its momentum to the sail and disexists - it is absorbed.

Light that is reflected changes direction. Now having opposite (or *almost* opposite) momentum, the momentum imparted on your sail is *double* the momentum imparted during an absorption event.

Thus, the momentum of the oncoming photon is either left as nothing or opposite of what it was.

You may note that something is amiss - if energy is transferred (as would happen when a sail is pushed on and moved), then the photon should actually carry *less* momentum after a reflection. This is correct. It will leave with slightly less momentum, but only slightly, and this difference in momentum correlates to a lower-frequency light.

In summary, light reflecting back from an object moving *towards* you carries *more* momentum and is 'blue-shifted', while light reflecting back from an object moving *away* from you carries *less* momentum and is thus 'red-shifted'.

This is actually how radar guns measure the speed of a moving vehicle - they see how much the frequency of the radar changes when it reflects."

Basically, I'm wondering if I had a plane that has a rated max altitude of 15,000 ft, if I were to transport it to the top of a plateau that is 30,000 ft high would I be able to take off and fly around above the plateau? If I can, what would happen if I flew over the edge of the plateau would the plane stall and drop until it was once again below 15,000 ft?",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: How an airplane's maximum altitude works,"'h4jfllw', 'h4jhhs1', 'h4jhmyj', 'h4jk18e', 'h4yydc4', 'h4yytzx'",6,"It would stall and drop. Air gets thinner as you go higher. Less air flowing over the wings means less lift. When lift is less than the force of gravity, the plane falls. To maintain enough lift for level flight, the plane can speed up to force more air over the wings and generate more lift. That requires more power from the engine.

Engines also require air - specifically, oxygen to combust the fuel. And there's no real substitute except for bringing your own oxygen, but at that point you've built a rocket with wings and instead of using wings for lift, you could just thrust yourself up.

There's another problem, which is heat from air compression as the plane slams its way through the air. Famously, the SR-71 Blackbird took novel, exceedingly expensive allows to withstand the heat. And, as things heat up they expand. If the panels on the plane fit snugly on the ground when cool, they would expand and buckle, destroying the aircraft. The panels on the SR-71 fit loosely on the ground, so it spilled fuel, coolant, and oil all over the place until it got into the air, warmed up, and refueled.

So, the ceiling for an aircraft depends on a lot of things. Trying to operate a plane above its ceiling will result in a stall: because the engines can't get enough oxygen, or the wings are the wrong shape can can't generate enough lift at that altitude+speed, or you launch it fast enough to get enough lift and the plane...uh...falls apart or bursts into flames or some combination thereof."

A camera sensor has a specific number of pixels (Well technically megapixels but they translate to a specific number of pixels when saved as a file). 

When the camera takes a photo and doesn't have space for a full pixel that the monitor has, it takes only a small portion of it or merges a couple pixels and gets an average. 

The monitor pixels are small bits of colors that brighten or darken to reveal the color it is supposed to be. 

This means the lines are created because only small bits of what is supposed to make that color are saved to the photo file. So if it requires red green and blue light to create white, but the camera can only take a small piece, it may no longer create white light and it might be slightly off white after averaging. This happens pixel after pixel and you end up with a line of slightly difference colors. 

That should explain the lines, now why the lines move is kind of the same thing but in reverse. 

There is more data available in the photo than there is on the monitor. When you zoom in it fits that new data into the areas of your monitor which were previously merged/hidden/averaged. 

You might be wondering why this doesn't happen with normal pictures, but it happens with pictures of a monitor. The answer is that monitors are unique to nature in that they have very contrasted colors next to each other to create a color, where color in real life is generally just that color. It does happen to other photos though, it just isn't as common or apparent because of how the colors are displayed. I see it sometimes when working with grey sweats (those grey sweaters/sweatpants that are made up of like small blotches of 3 different grey colors)."

you can get THC into edibles either by pure THC isolate powder/distillate OR by cannabis butter/oil. pure THC and distillate are very potent (most potent possible) and will make for very accurately dosed edibles. this is how most gummy-type edibles are made but some chocolates and baked goods go that route. most baked goods and many chocolate-type edibles use an infused butter or oil. some canna-butters are just a fat mixed with THC isolate/distillate but I'm lumping those in with the first type of edibles; MOST canna-butter is made by infusing a fat with de-carbed (activated) weed to extract the THC (which also extracts the CBD and terpenes). BUT weed plants aren't 100% consistent in potency and percentage of cannabinoids like pure isolate is, so it's a bit more unpredictable. TL;DR: isolate edibles and canna-butter edibles often lead to different highs because the potency of the edible can vary even though it reports the same mg of THC. 

if you smoke several times throughout the day, or maybe get super baked in the morning then smoke again later, have you noticed that you don't get as high as you did the first time? that's your tolerance building on a more daily level (different than your overall tolerance based on how frequently you smoke like how many days a week). to ELI5 the endocannabinoid system, cannabinoids bind to receptors when u have cannabis and aren't broken down and replaced so quickly that you can smoke all day and be as high as you were initially. so, if you smoke earlier in the day then have edibles later on, they might not hit you as hard as they would have if you hadn't smoked yet that day. (for me i can take 100mg w/o having smoked earlier and get way 2 high, but if i had smoked a lot it'll barely hit me) 

as for tolerance, if you normally *only* smoke bud (like even if you smoke every day), you'll still get super fucked up from edibles. but if you use edibles every day or 2 often, your tolerance will get suuuuper high very quickly. if you take 100mg one day then take 100mg the next day, that second time might feel more like 60mg bc your tolerance is up. 

NOTE: powdered THC edibles are more likely to make you paranoid/psychotic/anxious because they dont include CBD and terps, THC alone w/o the other cannabinoids doesn't behave the same in ur body (sacrificing consistent potency for a better time haha). so sometimes if you feel 2 high after taking a mg you've previously taken and didn't get 2 high, it might actually be because you took isolate vs. canna-butter edibles

However as the coldness dissipates, those blood vessels rapidly dilate and allow blood to flood back into the affected area, which puts pressure on nearby nerves as they swell and causes the characteristic painful sensation in the head and face.

aslfingerspell,1625766198,ogcbo6,"For example, here's BoardGameGeek's definition of a Eurogame: [https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Eurogame](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Eurogame)

* Player conflict is indirect, with little or no combat.
* No player elimination.
* Minimal randomness i.e. dice are rare.
* Emphasis on the game designer i.e. their name on the front cover
* Attention to artwork, pieces, and theming. 
* Deep strategy, with minimal game mechanics but multiple paths to victory.

The problem with this kind of definition is that so many strategy games would seem to fit this mold despite never being marketed as or considered Euros, especially with the disclaimer that not all Euro games need to meet all the points of the definition. *Civilization* would seem to fit, but I've never heard it called a Euro game:

* While war is a game mechanic, the latest Civ games are not *wargames per se* with a huge variety of win conditions. The other ways to win involve indirect competition like building wonders first, spreading your religion, or gaining cultural influence.
* Players get eliminated in Civ, but this doesn't always happen and isn't strictly necessary for non-Domination victories.
* Randomness in starting position and combat. This is the biggest point against it being a Euro by BGG's definition, but the other points seem okay.
* It's *Sid Meier's Civilization*, so emphasis on the designer certainly fits.
* Maybe this is somewhat N/A or redundant since video games by definition always have some emphasis on graphics, but Civ has tons of detailed models of units, terrain, and cities. It also really does love its theming with you meeting historical leaders, civ-unique units, wonder buildings, and so on.
* The mechanics of Civ aren't minimalistic, but there is deep strategy and multiple ways to win.",explainlikeimfive,"ELI5: What exactly is a ""Euro"" board game or Eurogame?

I think between Carcassone, Settlers and maybe a few others like Power Grid, Ticket to Ride, those were some of the really popular Eurogames that came about in the mid-late 90s early 2000s that really brought board gaming (and any table top gaming, D&amp;D too) back into the mainstream. The concept of going over to a friends house to play D&amp;D or a _board_ game in North America before 1998 or so would have been laughable. ""You mean... like Risk? Monopoly? No thanks I have to wash my hair"".

Before Settlers came about board games were Risk, Monopoly, Sorry, Game of Life - where yeah, there is a _little_ bit of strategy but mostly its based on chance: who goes first, what people roll, getting lucky starting placement or pieces.

Even the MB master series games like Shogun, Axis and Allies, Fortress America - those were ""euro style"" board games well before their time, but they too were really just trumped up Risk - based on who and where you started and how the dice rolls go, you could be eliminated in as soon as a few turns. God, especially if you started off as Russia.

In Settlers: starting position is random; resource collection is randomized to a degree; the worst you can do is only have the same two starting villages and 4 road segments as you can't actually be eliminated, but I've seen lots of games where people have won with just those two villages and _lots_ of victory points all obtained through trade.

Great replies already!

To add to these:

It's blue because of the colors given off from nitrogen and oxygen gas in our atmosphere when they are excited (-&gt; When the metal contacts are close enough for the electricity to move through the air. The larger the gap, the higher the voltage would need to be). 

Kind of why  old neon lights have different colors, different gasses will glow in all kind of colors when excited/applying a high voltage.

The gasses are actually excited beyond the gas phase (solid-&gt;liquid-&gt;gas-&gt;*Plasma*).

Electrons reach a higher energy state, and when ""dropping back down"" they emit photons (=light).

They dug trenches and poured concrete bunkers. You could easily complete multiple bunkers in a single day. The Nazis had years before the allied invasion.

The biggest component of the ""wall"" was actually artillery. They didn't place the artillery to fire out to sea. Rather they placed it to fire down the length of the beaches. Allowing single installations of multiple pieces to miles and miles of beach with ease.

Then they mined the shit out of the beaches and placed this big steel tripods called ""Czech hedgehogs"" which are impassable for tanks. Then they filled the rest in with fences and barbed wire.

The goal wasn't to fully stop and invasion like you'd expect a true wall to do. That would be impossible. As the Nazis showed, you can outmaneuver emplacements like that when they went around the French Maginot line to conquer France. The real goal was to slow down the enemy substantially and give the troops inland time to reinforce the area and push the invasion back.

It probably would've worked too if not for the extremely skilled work of the allied intelligence both gaining Intel and feeding the Nazis substantial misinformation.

The end of the test strip is basically a circuit with one end coated with an enzyme. That enzyme is made to pair with glucose and glucose only, like a puzzle piece. The free enzyme has a certain amount of electrical conductivity, or it will absorb a certain amount of electricity from that circuit. The bonded enzyme has a different conductivity. The monitor itself runs a current through the test strip and measures the change in current flowing out from the current it sent in. It uses that to calculate how much of the enzyme has reacted with the glucose in the blood and gives you a concentration of your blood glucose.

The same thing happens with CGM. A filament coated with an enzyme is inserted into the interstitial space (as you mentioned). This filament is a conductor like the test strips. Through a constant supply of a light current it measures the conductivity of the enzyme to find how much has reacted. Then it plots it over time. Eventually all of the enzyme will have reacted and the filament will need replaced. That time varies by manufacturer."

Co-Pay: The portion of the fee for seeing the provider. Your health insurance will be billed for the rest.

Coinsurance: this is different than a Co-Pay. Say your doctor’s visit for whatever, cost $500. Your insurance will pay, for example 80% of that $500, and you pay the remaining 20%. So your insurance paid $400 and you paid $100. 

Typically, Co-insurance goes towards your out of pocket and deductible costs. Co-insurance is also typically used by PPOs and Co-Pays are for HMOs. 

PPO: Preferred Provider Organization. Basically creates a larger network of covered providers and services. You pay less for being in their service range

HMO: Health Maintenance Organization. Basically means that only providers contracted with the HMO Plan can be used, but also MUCH cheaper when using those providers.

But what he did come up with was following on from the work of many other mathematicians and physicists (including Galileo) - adding to what they did.

---------------

Newton published his Laws of Motion in his epic work *[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica)* (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). The first edition was published in 1687, when Newton was in his 40s and already the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge (one of the most prestigious maths/physics chairs in the world, since held by the likes of Babbage, Stokes, Dirac, Hawking and - in fiction - Data).

Nowadays we know his 2nd law as:

&gt; F = m a

where F, m and a are defined appropriately (with F and a being vectors if needed), or maybe as:

&gt; F = dp/dt

i.e. force is the rate of change of momentum.

Newton didn't define them this way, not least because he didn't have algebra (never mind vectors). Algebra was just taking off in European mathematics at the time, but he did his work with geometry. This is why it isn't necessarily worth reading his *Principia Mathematica* to learn (mathematical) physics; it is clumsily written because he didn't have the mathematical tools we have today (although he did help invent some to make it work). Plus the original is in Latin. Borrowing from the [1729 translation into English](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Mathematical_Principles_of_Natural_Philosophy_(1729\)/Axioms,_or_Laws_of_Motion), Newton expressed the law as:

&gt; The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impress'd; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impress'd.

&gt; If any force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impress'd altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force) if the body moved before, is added to or subducted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely joyned, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.

""Motion"" was his ""[Definition II](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Mathematical_Principles_of_Natural_Philosophy_(1729\)/Definitions):""

&gt; The Quantity of Motion is the measure of the same, arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly.

i.e. what we would call momentum (""quantity of matter"" being what we would call ""mass""). He didn't feel the need to define ""velocity"" or go into more detail on these terms.

Putting that all together, that isn't ""F = ma"" or ""Force = mass * acceleration"" - what he is calling motion we would call momentum, and his ""impressed force"" is what we might call ""impulse"":

&gt; Impulse = change in momentum

So where did he get the Second Law from? He generalised from the work of earlier mathematicians and physicists. To quote from his commentary on the laws:

&gt; Hitherto I have laid down such principles as have been received by mathematicians, and are confirmed by abundance of experiment. By the first two Laws and the first two Corollaries, Galileo discovered that the descent of bodies observed the duplicate ratio of the time, and that the motion of projectiles was in the curve of a parabola; experience agreeing with both, unless so far as these motions are a little retarded by the resistance of the air.

By my reading of this, he is acknowledging that these laws aren't really his laws. They were already known and understood by others including Galileo (who died months before Newton was born). What Newton did was put them all together in one place, define some things, and then do a lot of work with them (particularly applying them to gravity).

----

So what we see is that Newton didn't really come up with his Second Law of Motion, and certainly didn't come up with it in the form we use it today.

 Bear with me...

MRI - magnetic resonance imaging -  uses the principle of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), specifically the NMR behavior of hydrogen atoms.  H has just one proton in its nucleus.  Hydrogen atoms are part of all different kinds of molecules in the body - water molecules, different kinds of fat molecules, collagen, etc.  The nuclei (protons) of these various hydrogen atoms in different molecules exist in very different environments, influenced by the density of the electron clouds around them, which depends on what kind of molecule it is.  MRI exploits these differences, so that the protons in a water molecule, for example, can give either a brighter or a darker signal than those in fat, depending on the settings on the MRI, which you'll see from what's written below means how the area being scanned is pulsed with radio waves.  We call this a pulse sequence, and they have gotten quite ingenious with various pulse sequences.

Protons have available to them two separate quantum states, with respect to a phenomenon called ""spin.""  When the proton is put into a magnetic field, these two states separate into a higher and a lower energy state, and most of the protons will settle into the lower energy state.  If the proton is hit (""pulsed"") with a radio wave pulse having the same amount of energy (which really means frequency) as the energy  between those two spin states, protons in the lower energy spin state will be boosted into the higher energy spin state.  The lower energy spin state is aligned with the magnetic field (magnetic fields have a directionality to them), but the higher energy spin state is not, and now with more protons in the higher energy spin state, their spin, all summed together as a group, produces a radio wave signal that can be detected by a coil placed on the body part.  The coil serves as both the delivery system for the pulse and the receiving system for the signal.  So the coil would be called a transducer.  It delivers a radio wave pulse and collects a radio wave signal.  Exactly how the pulses are delivered is what the pulse sequence is all about.

Over a period of milliseconds to seconds, the excited (which means they're in the higher energy state) protons will relax back to the lower energy state, and these pulsating radio wave signals will disappear.  How fast they disappear varies with the type of molecule the proton is part of, and this property is used to distinguish between tissue types.  Pulsing the protons over and over again with the radio wave stimulus repeats this process (pulse - collect - pulse - collect, etc), and the radio wave signal that is collected each time can be summed together, so that electronic noise is reduced, and the true signal emerges.  The signal emitted by the spin of the excited protons and detected by the coil has a frequency that is precisely the same as the difference between the energies of the low spin state and the high spin state.  So like a radio that can receive a radio wave consisting of all different frequencies in a song, the coil in an MRI can pick up, and the electronics can distinguish all these frequencies as well.  Now you have a bunch of different radio signals, all having different frequencies and intensities.

The trick is knowing exactly where each of the collected radio wave signals came from in the body part being scanned.  This was the genius of MRI.  The difference in energy between the low energy and high energy spin states of the proton is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.  Stronger magnetic field = bigger difference in the two energy states.  So in an MRI machine, you have a high-intensity magnetic field in the form of a big permanent magnet, and then a smaller magnetic field that varies in a precise fashion across the length of the coil placed over the body part being scanned (a ""gradient"" field).  So since you now know the total strength of the magnetic field at every spot on the body part, you can assign each frequency obtained in your radio signal to a specific spot on the body part under the coil, and you know the intensity of the signal, which is translated into brightness.  This gives you 2D resolution - think of the xy axis.  The third dimension is obtained by changing the phase of the signal along the third axis - think of the z axis.  In the end, you have intensity of signal information for each volume element (voxel, the 3D equivalent of a 2D pixel) in the area scanned, and this is converted by the computer (big computer) into a 3D model.  Then the computer creates 2D slices in different directions through the 3D model, which is what we end up looking at in the pictures.

To finish this all up with a little opinion, this invention was brilliant and deserved the Nobel Prize in Medicine (2003)."

This can come about in a number of ways: in Venice, when the water level rises, they build a new level on the top of the buildings and shore up the old basements, often by filling them with rubble of the places that didn’t withstand the pressures of increased height.

In places like Jerusalem, it’s due to conquest.  When a new group invades and tears down the walls, the old foundations are left, and the dirt of daily life and rubble makes it easier to build on top than to re-excavate.

In other cases, the city is abandoned, and nature does the rest, blowing in sand and dirt.

What you pour it into doesn't have to be a true solid. It could, but doesn't have to be. You can cast iron into sand, which is readily available and can form rough shapes, and it has the benefit of a higher melting temperature than iron.

You seem, though, to be getting at ""If you keep casting things into things that can't be melted by that liquid thing, and if you keep going up that chain, how do you cast that highest melting temperature thing.""

Melting is a physical change. You heat it up until it changes phase. You can shape that liquid into a form, cool it back into a solid, and you're good. But there's more ways to turn a not-solid thing into a solid thing. Chemical changes!

The most common one in this chain of thought is the production of ceramics. You can take clay, which is moldable at room temperature, and bake it at high temps. This forces out the water and the clay undergoes a transformation into a ceramic. This is a simple way of making molds that can withstand high temperatures without having to first mold the material the mold is made of (and further have a mold that can withstand *that* temperature, and so on)."

Kind of

Full blown flashing is inefficient, it only lets you send 1 bit per change so sending information at 1 Gigabit per second requires adjusting the state of the light every nanosecond.  The flashing is very resistant to noise which is good for longer distance, but is an inefficient use of a cable.

Copper ethernet cables basically do this but rely on multiple wires to give you better bandwidth.  They have a pair of wires where one is high and the other low for a 0 and low/high for a 1.  Similar to above this isn't very efficient which is why gigabit ethernet has to use all 4 pairs of wires in the cable, so each one only has to flip every 2 nanoseconds at most.

The better way to ram data through your wire is with a form of modulation.  What if instead of having your little colored laser alternate between full on and full off, it went between off, 1/3 on, 2/3 on, full on.  Now you can slip 2 bits into each state change!  This is Amplitude Modulation.

Now take a red laser and a blue laser, they can both travel in the same channel without interfering, and amplitude module both of them.  Now each state change you can have 1 of 4 red levels and 1 of 4 blue levels for 16 options (4 bits), this is QAM-16(Quadrature amplitude modulation - aka two signals being amplitude modulated together).  Still using the same cable, but now we can get 16x as much through it.

Boost your transmitter and receiver precision so they can differentiate 16 different levels per color, now each transition carries 1 of 256 different options so you can get 8x as much data down the line as you could just having one laser turning on/off.  This is handy because it can let you greatly upgrade the bandwidth of an existing fiber optic cable just by adjusting the equipment on the end and doesn't require laying potentially hundreds of miles of new cable just for more bandwidth."

In the case of infinities, lets look at what it means for their to be the same number of somethings.

How can we know that a dozen donuts is the same amount as a dozen eggs?

Well one way is to see if you can pair them off one by one. If you can associate each egg with one donut, and all eggs are used and all donuts are used then they have the same amount.

Instead of comparing donuts to eggs, you can compare them to numbers. If I can associate each egg to a number between 1 and 12, and I accept that there are 12 numbers then I know that there are 12 eggs. If I **can't** create such a mapping I know they have a different size.  So if I have have 12 eggs and want to map them to only 6 numbers, there is no way to do it because I'll run out of numbers before eggs.

So if we take this concept of size where two things are of equal size if and only if we can create a mapping between them, we can extend this to infinity. For instance you can look at the natural numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...) and the integers (...,-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...). Intuitively it seems like there should be 2x+1 as many integers than natural numbers. But again the definition is, can I create a mapping from one to another where each element used once, and you can: 1=0, 2=-1, 3=1,4=-2,5=2,6=-3,7=3. For every natural number n you can find a unique integer that it is associated with, and for every integer you can find a unique natural number. So we conclude since such a mapping exists, that they are the same size. You can do the same thing with rational numbers and the integers, or with two dimensional spaces and single dimensional spaces.

But are there mappings that can't be created. Yes, for instance you can't create a mapping between the real numbers and natural numbers. There is a proof which shows that even if you had such a mapping you could always generate a new real number that doesn't have an natural number.  I don't find the proof satisfactory, but another example is the set of subsets. If you look at a set of numbers, say {1,2,3}, and you look at the set of all subsets {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3},{1,2,3}} there is a proof says that the set of all subsets of a set can never have a such a mapping from the original set, so we know that subsets of natural numbers are infinite but bigger than the set of natural numbers.

It *isn't* imaginary. Those numbers we call ""imaginary"" exist and are as real as the numbers we call ""real."" So why do we call them ""imaginary"" when they're real?

Because they were named by people that didn't like those numbers. Imagine, when you were born, there was a host of people that irrationally hated you and your existence and **they got to name you**. Imagine being named by your worst enemies.

And then, that name sticks for your entire life.

That's the situation with ""i"" and ""imaginary numbers.""

To explain further, consider the Natural numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3...

You can't do much with these numbers. You can add and multiply. You can *sometimes* subtract and divide. But when you try to do things like 2 - 3, things break. You don't get an answer *within the set of Natural numbers.*

We can do one of two things. We can simply say there is no answer to those kinds of questions. Or we can extend our numbers to *include* those answers.

So let's do that. Now we have the Integers: ...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...

Now we can add, multiply, and subtract. We can *sometimes* divide. For example, when you try to do 1/2 we don't get an answer *within the set of Integers.* So we extend our numbers to include all ratios of Integers.

Now we have the rational numbers. All of the integers plus things like 1/2, and -22/7.

But, it turns out that there are numbers that *can't* be represented by ratios of Integers. Pi. The square root of two. (Almost all square roots, in fact). Again, we can just say they don't exist (even though they do) or we can extend our numbers to include them.

Now we have the ""Real"" numbers.

We can add. We can subtract. We can multiply. We can divide\*.

But what about powers and roots? Seems like we can't take even roots of negative numbers. Again, we can simply say these numbers don't exist or we can extend our numbers to include them.

Well, for a long while, mathematicians took the first route. And this shouldn't be surprising. For every example here (except probably rational numbers), it took a while for those numbers to be accepted as simply numbers that exist. Negative numbers. Irrational Numbers. Heck, even 0. There was some level of resistance in accepting these as ""real"" numbers that exist and were meaningful.

All of this was the same for ""imaginary"" numbers, perhaps even more so. Mathematicians were basically *forced* to acknowledge their existence because the square roots of negative numbers were necessary in solving some of the problems mathematicians were working on at the time. And even though those numbers were necessary, mathematicians using them called them derogatory names like ""useless"" and ""imaginary."" It is simply an unfortunate quirk of history that the term ""imaginary"" became the common place name for them because, as I have stated, they are just as ""real"" and useful as negative numbers, fractions, and irrational numbers.

*i* is no less ""real"" as a number than 1, 1/2, or *e*.

The first pronoun (he/she) are *subject* pronouns. It would be the subject of a sentence:

*He* ran.

*She* ate.

etc.

The second pronoun (him/her) are *object* pronouns:

...gave the book to *her*.

...waited for *him.*

etc.

We have historically just assumed a person's pronouns by their apparent biological sex. But it turns out that people do not always feel that the gender associated with those pronouns (or their biological sex) is appropriate for them. It does not accurately reflect their thoughts about themselves and their self-identity.

So they may desire to have different pronouns used for them. A person that would typically have been referred to by male pronouns may wish instead to be referred to by female pronouns and vice versa.

In some cases, a person feels that none of the available options are suitable. They may opt for existing general neutral pronouns (they/them) or new pronouns created for these cases (xe/xem is fairly common).

Given this explanation, what do you do?

First, on social media, many people have taken to displaying their preferred pronouns as part of their username or profile. So if you are communicating with someone, or talking about someone, it helps to check that information to see what is preferred.

Second, it cannot hurt you to simply ask the person what they prefer. Contrary to popular belief, people that prefer non-standard pronouns generally do not get irate when someone uses the ""incorrect"" pronoun on them, and they will simply correct you. It's usually only when the misgendering is persistent, deliberate, or there is some preexisting antagonism that a person may get upset.

The key is to simply be open minded and respectful. Every individual has a right to determine their own identity and no one else has a right to deny them that."

That's the main benefit. The downsides are the cost of having additional hard drives and needing specialized hardware/software to implement RAID functionality.

RAID 0 basically takes your data and spreads it out evenly over multiple disks. This does not provide for backup and recovery, but can improve performance and allows the computer to access data faster. The downside is the loss of any single hard drive in the array makes the entire array unusual as your data is broken up across all of them.

RAID 1 is a simple mirroring of one hard drive to another. This provides the simplest form of backup and recovery. If one hard drive fails, you have an exact copy of it. But it isn't very efficient.

RAID 2 is basically just a different implementation of RAID 0. RAID 0 distributes data across individual hard drives in clumps called ""blocks"" whereas RAID 2 does it on a bit-by-bit basis. However it does implement a simple form of error correction whereas RAID 0 does not.

RAID 3 is like RAID 0 and RAID 2, but it operates at the byte level (rather than block or bit) and one of the disks of the array is dedicated for *parity*. The parity disk examples the data on all the other disks and stores the parity of that data. For example, with RAID 3 we're storing information byte-by-byte. Let's say the first byte on the first disk is 01010101 and the first byte on the second disk is 00001111 and the first byte on the third disk is 00111100. The first byte of the parity disk looks at the first byte on all the other disks and counts how many ""1""s appear at each bit place. It then stores a ""0"" if there are an even amount of ""1""s and stores a ""1"" if there are an odd amount of ""1""s like so:

&amp;#x200B;

|First Disk|01010101|
|:-|:-|
|Second Disk|00001111|
|Third Disk|00111100|
|Parity Disk|01100110|

Having a parity disk allows the recovery of a single hard drive. If a hard drive fails, you can construct what the missing byte would be by looking at the remaining bytes, the parity, then constructing the missing byte by using whatever bits are necessary to make the parity correct.

RAID 4 is like RAID 3 but operates on block level.

RAID 5 is like RAID 4 but the parity blocks are distributed across all of the hard drives in the array rather than being confined to one. The parity blocks only come into play when a disk fails, so having all of the parity blocks on a single hard drive means you have an entire hard drive that is hardly being used, increasing the wear and tear on the other hard drives. By distributing the parity blocks throughout, you include all the hard drives and distribute this stress more evenly.

RAID 6 extends RAID 5 by having two parity blocks per data block and therefore can support the loss of up to two hard drives."

The earliest stages that we know about are very poorly understood, because at this point the universe was made up of matter that was so hot and dense that we don't really have anything to compare it to to understand how it would behave. For example there is some evidence pointing to the idea that the universe went through a period of *ridiculously* rapid expansion known as ""inflation"", but nobody is really sure what would have caused this. It's widely suspected that in the very early universe, the effects of quantum gravity - that is, the gravitational interactions between individual particles - were significant, but our knowledge of quantum gravity is extremely limited because, as the universe is now, those interactions are far too weak to be measurable with current technology.

Physicists have various speculative ideas about what might have happened before all this. Maybe the universe popped into existence from nothing, or maybe it was just always expanding and as you go back in time it gets denser and denser without limit, or maybe it goes through a cycle of collapsing then exploding again. Maybe there are many universes that have gone through big bangs at different times. Some of these ideas have been developed into elaborate theories, but there isn't really any evidence that points to one in particular being correct. And I'm not sure there is any good reason to believe that laws such as conservation of energy did or didn't apply to any of these hypothetical processes, since they're so far outside our current understanding."

Not quite. Instead, mathematicians were trying to solve a certain class of problems. In doing so, they came across the square root of negative numbers. In the end, those square roots cancelled out, but the fact that they could exist without breaking everything indicated that there was something there.

Mathematicians still didn't like it and these numbers were treated with derision for along while, but we've come to eventually accept them as a valid extension of the real numbers.

&gt;But there still stuff we can't calculate in any of the number sets we have. Something we see much earlier than roots: division by 0.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
  
I get why x / 0 = x is false. Basically that would mean that 1 = 0, which is absurd (reductio ad absurdum). Ok. I don't quite get why x/0 = 0 is false, but I'm sure there's a contradiction somewhere that would make this impossible (if it was that simple, division by 0 would have been solved thousand of years prior). But if we can simply invent a number that doesn't exists and it can fit maths no problem such as i = √-1 why can't we make a number n = 0\^(-1)?

Ok. Let's say x/0 = 0. That means x = 0\*0; x = 0. So it would only work for x = 0. If you tried it for any other value of x, you'd immediately get a contradiction (1/0 = 0 implies 1 = 0; 2/0 = 0 implies 2=0, etc.)

But there's issues even with saying 0/0 = 0.

When we ask ""What is a/b"" we're asking, ""What can we multiply b by to get a?"" This means ""What is 0/0"" we're asking ""What can we multiply 0 by to get 0."" And the answer is *anything*. So there isn't a single answer to that question.

At the end of  the day, trying to assign a value to x/0 ends up in contradictions or otherwise breaking fundamental mathematical concepts.

Compared to square root of negative numbers were shown to be necessary and have greatly expanded our understanding of math."

Your blood *volume* certainly does go down temporarily, until your body can release more fluid into your blood stream and eventually produce more blood cells, but pressure is another matter.

The body can regulate blood pressure through a variety of factors such as the previously mentioned addition or subtraction of fluid from the blood, as well as by changing the diameter of the blood vessels themselves (yes, they are tiny muscular tubes). If the blood vessels reduce in size then your blood pressure will go up, and if they relax it goes down.

That means all the heavy metals, but also lighter elements like silicon and oxygen and aluminum that make up the rocky crust of the solid planets.

These all get blown out of dead/dying stars in a vast cloud of dust and gas that wanders off to mingle with the rest of the nearby systems.

Much later, that material coalesces into planets when new stars are born and incorporate the debris from the old stars.

The young planets aren’t solid though, the intense heat from gravitational collapse leaves them entirely molten, and the heavy elements sink to the core and leave only the lighter elements.

This leaves the crust of a planet mostly depleted.  To get rich metal deposits near the surface one of two things must happen:

1) a young planet is obliterated in a massive collision, spewing solid metal asteroids from the shattered core out into space.  These metal fragments crash into other planets and leave metal deposits there.

2) the Earth gets whacked by a large asteroid that melts a small section of the crust.  This lets the small amount of metal in the rock sink to the bottom of the molten crater, but not all the way into the core."

This is something the OBM has discussed in the past, but the general result was that ""that there was no agreement
on a definition for this category"". See page 588787 of that document I just linked for a bit of discussion on the topic.   
  
That said, people are not ""put into"" any category for the US census. The Census includes a 'fill in the blank' option if you don't feel that the available choices are reasonable, and there is no census standard for what defines each choice. So a person, or a group of people, can choose to respond with whatever they feel are the best choices among those given, and/or put down their own unique answer in the blank."

In computers that would be writing caches/deleting caches, writing saved setting to a config file, sending some data to a server, making sure open documents are saved.

A ""kill"" command, what task manager does, is like the fire alarm going off in a factory. Everyone just drops everything and runs out. (Maybe more accurately it would be like if someone just took the factory and launched into space with no traces left of it. The OS just drops the task associated with the application"") 

Alt - F4 is a Windows OS specific shortcut that sends a kill command to currently focused window. Which is why it often doesn't work for some application that fail to launch completely. Applications can be made to ""intercept"" this command though.

He knows the answer, he will always pick the *other wrong option*. Him opening the doors isn't new information to you, you already knew that one of the doors you did not pick is a goat. 

So: here are three ways to explain why switching is better:


1 ) Just draw out the possibilities.

You pick goat A and stick : Goat

You pick goat A and swap : Car

You pick goat B and stick : Goat

You pick goat B and swap : Car

You pick Car and stick : Car

You pick Car and swap : Goat


Out of the six possible scenarios, swapping got you a car twice, but sticking to your initial choice only got you a car once. 


b ) Multiply the doors:

Imagine instead of picking between three doors, you pick between 100. You pick a door, and Monty opens 98 doors revealing 98 goats. Given Monty knows where the car is, are you more confident that among 100 doors you managed to hit the car first try, or would you rather have the door Monty, who knows where the car is, just so happened not to open when revealing 98 goats in a row? 


c ) By ignoring the door opening all together. 

Imagine that instead of Monty opening the doors he says ""Ok, you can keep that one door you picked, or you can open *the other two doors* and keep whatever you find in those two. Now obviously swapping is better, because you get two prizes instead of one, doubling your odds for a car. However, is this really a different scenario? You know that you will get at least one goat if you open two doors instead of one, that is information granted to you from the start. With that in mind, what is really the difference between you opening two doors and revealing a goat and a second prize, or Monty opening that goat door for you and you opening the second prize door?"

The ports that the service is actually running on. Very often the same as the external port, but doesn't have to be.

External port: the port that people *outside* of your network use to connect to you. This essentially can be treated as the port open on the router, not the server.

For instance: imagine you have a server with internal IP 127.9.8.7, who is running a server on port 1234. Inside the network you can connect to it using 127.9.8.7:1234 and everything is fine.

Now imagine your router has the IP address 20.20.20.20. This is the IP that *other computers* out there in the world use to connect to your network. Now, your network might contain dozens of computers, and all of them may be running servers. How does the router know to route the message to your specific machine?

Well, that's where the external port comes in. You can tell your router ""Any time someone connects to 20.20.20.20:9999, send it to 127.9.8.7:1234""

From there on if someone wants to connect to your server form outside the network they send a connection to 20.20.20.20:9999, and it gets redirected to 127.9.8.7:1234. 

9999 is your external port, and 1234 your internal port.

So zero plus 1 is 1, now it’s 0, 1, 1….1+1=2, now it’s 0, 1, 1, 2…then 0,1,1,2,3,5…0,1,1,2,3,5,8 and so on getting bigger and bigger…spiraling out…get it?

Rivers run down montains collecting salt from the rocks and when it rains salt gets washed into the river and through the river salt goes to the ocean. Very very little sat though, that's why rivers aren't salty.

Why are oceans salty though? Because water gets removed (temporarily) by evaporating, then it rains down somewhere and washes back into the ocean with a little more salt again.

Additionally other things like gums usually need to be added mechanically with a blender or stirrers to get the full effect.

Eggs don't require much to work, no real prep no special temps. And they're quite good binders too. Each egg yolk can hold up to about 7x it's volume in additional liquid or oil. Eggs are stable, both the whites and the yolks can be used for stabilizing. (Whites not as common because of their low binding abilities)

Also eggs can be eaten by themselves in many different ways so just another plus"

You are correct. The difference is in the activity level you select, although TDEE with a sedentary activity level should be pretty much the same as BMR.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;what is the difference between BMR and maintenance calories

BMR is how many calories your body burns on a daily basis just by existing. Maintenance calories is how many calories you need to eat so you don't lose weight or gain weight. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; if different calculators are giving conflicting results (because you're unsure of your activity level, what should you do?

These calculators are only estimates to give you a starting point. You can see that right in the description of the activity level - ""active"" might say something like ""exercise 3-5 days per week"". Well, obviously you are not burning the same number of calories with 3 days of exercise as you are with 5 days of exercise.

You pick whatever estimate you want to start with. Unless you never get off the couch, most people are probably ok to start with ""moderate"". Get a scale and weigh your food so you actually know how many calories you are eating. Guessing is always wrong. Weigh yourself and log your weight. If you aren't losing/maintaining/gaining in line with your goals after a couple of weeks, adjust your calories up or down. You are not going to have any massive change to your weight in any direction in 2 weeks, so this is a safe way to do it and it is the most accurate way to do it since everyone's body responds differently to calories and activity."

It's not. When your nose really has that blocked feeling that isn't relieved by blowing your nose, it's because the tissue inside your nose is inflamed and swollen. The swelling obstructs your nasal passages so air can no longer get through (or at least it's much harder).

If you can reduce the swelling, that opens up your nasal passages to breathe through. One way to do this is through physical exercise. When your body goes into ""physical activity mode"", it directs more blood to your muscles. That blood has to come from somewhere, and one of the places that the body sends less blood to is your nose. Less blood in your nose means less swelling.

Another way is to ""trick"" your body into ""activity mode"", at least locally. Certain nasal sprays contain chemicals that mimic adrenaline, the body's ""action hormone"". Applying this fake adrenaline to your nose causes the blood vessels there to constrict (become narrower), directing blood away from the nose just as if you were really doing physical exercise, and thus again reducing the swelling and letting your breathe more easily.

Menthol doesn't seem to have this effect, as far as my limited research can tell me (e.g. [link](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11882-003-0041-6.pdf)). People *feel* like it helps decongest their nose, but objective measurements of airflow tell a very different story - if anything menthol (being a mild irritant) seems to cause more congestion.

So why do people feel like it works? Menthol does seem to have a mild soothing effect, so that might make it less painful for you to breathe through your stuffy inflamed nose (unless you overdo it, in which case the menthol can become irritating). In addition, the cool sensation that menthol provides (because it actually activates cold receptors in the body) may trick you into feeling like more air is coming in through your nose, when it isn't (because you more clearly feel the air moving through your nose, and breathing freely is normally associated with a slight cooling of your nasal passages as well as the air you breathe is usually colder than you are)."

A black hole is a mass so heavy that nothing can escape from it if it gets too close.  Black holes are very small (smaller than an atom), but the region around the black hole that nothing can escape from is called the event horizon.  For a very heavy black hole, the event horizon can be large, some are even larger than our entire solar system.  

Scientists have figured out that everywhere in the universe, very tiny particles spontaneously pop into existence all the time.  Because of the conservation of energy, these particles have to be created in pairs that cancel each other out; for every electron created, a positron will be created at the same time and in the same place.  These spontaneous particle pairs tend to crash into each other and vanish almost immediately after being created, so we don't usually detect them.  

Hawking theorized that if a particle/antiparticle pair appeared right on the edge of the event horizon of a black hole, one of the particles might get sucked into the black hole while the other particle wasn't.  Because the particle no longer has a ""partner"", it can't vanish.  These particles can escape the black hole and are called Hawking Radiation.  

Because of the law of conservation of energy, the energy needed to create the new particles must have come from somewhere, and Hawking proved mathematically that the energy is actually coming from the black hole.  So for every particle of Hawking Radiation, the black hole is loosing some energy and getting smaller.  The amount of Hawking radiation coming from a black hole is actually quite small, and it would take unimaginable time for the radiation to meaningfully shrink the size of a black hole."

But if numbers are infinite, than the ability to continuously shrink down and get those decimals is infinite too. Doesn't that mean it's impossible to get these measurements?

And if these measurements are physically impossible to find, since the requirements for them are physically impossible to occur, doesn't that mean that no object in the world has a physical set size?

It is a philosophical position or condition. Nihility means ""nothingness"", and ""nihil"" is the Latin word for ""nothing"". Nihilism can mean the belief that values are meaningless ideas. It can also mean the belief that nothing has any meaning or purpose. In fact, there are many different beliefs that can be called nihilism. 

The German thinker Friedrich Nietzsche wrote many things about nihilism. What he wrote is often called the most important explanation of nihilism. Nietzsche wrote that nihilism comes from questioning traditional values until they fall apart. This is called ""value destruction"".  
  
The Russian thinker Mikhail Bakunin inspired a lot of nihilists because he believed this kind of destruction was good. The word ""nihilism"" was then made popular by a Russian novel called *Fathers and Sons* by Ivan Turgenev. The hero of the story is a nihilist named Bazarov. Some other Russian thinkers such as Dmitry Pisarev also wrote good things about this kind of destruction. Russian nihilism inspired many revolutionaries, such as Sergei Nechaev and Vladimir Lenin. The Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky was almost also a nihilist. But he became an anti-nihilist after ten years in exile. He wrote about nihilism in many novels such as *Crime and Punishment*.   
  
Nietzsche thought value destruction could not be avoided, even though it has bad results. He also thought Christianity was a source of this value destruction, and was therefore a kind of nihilism. According to the French writer Gilles Deleuze, he thought Christianity was nihilistic because it was life-denying, meaning it has a negative and unhealthy attitude towards living. Religious thinkers have instead thought that nihilism comes from rejecting religion. Some parts of Buddhism have also been called a kind of nihilism, even though other parts strongly reject nihilism. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the word ""nihilism"" was mostly used against people who rejected religion or believed in nothing. Either way, nihilism is often seen as a word for life-denying beliefs."

You're understanding is wrong. I think the best way to approach this is by using analogy of OCR, where you use a computer to convert an image to text

So the computer sees an image of the letter ""A"", a needs to convert it into the binary 00001. This is done by using a computer program that can detects patterns of data.

But under the original interpretation of this clause, they couldn’t restrict commerce inside of a single state.  

This is why both the abolition of slavery and the prohibition of alcohol were done via constitutional amendment. Congress simply didn’t have the power to do so otherwise.

This changed with *Wickard v. Filburn*.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn

The basics of the case:

&gt;An Ohio farmer, Roscoe Filburn, was growing wheat to feed animals on his own farm. The US government had established limits on wheat production, based on the acreage owned by a farmer, to stabilize wheat prices and supplies. Filburn grew more than was permitted and so was ordered to pay a penalty. In response, he said that because his wheat was not sold, it could not be regulated as commerce, let alone ""interstate"" commerce

The Supreme Court disagreed.

&gt;The Court decided that Filburn's wheat-growing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for animal feed on the open market, which is traded nationally, is thus interstate, and is therefore within the scope of the Commerce Clause. Although Filburn's relatively small amount of production of more wheat than he was allotted would not affect interstate commerce itself, the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers like Filburn would become substantial. Therefore the Court decided that the federal government could regulate Filburn's production.

This interpretation of the Commerce Clause granted Congress *way* more power to regulate the economy, since almost anything could be considered interstate commerce under the reasoning SCOTUS used in this case. 

That reasoning is why Congress can, for example, criminalize the production and use of drugs like marijuana or heroin with legislation rather than requiring a constitutional amendment.

*United States v. Lopez* somewhat curtailed this broad view of interstate commerce, but not much.  *Gonzales v. Raich* upheld the view of marijuana grown at home for personal use as being interstate commerce, for example."

When applying math to reality, you would try to ensure that the defining math characteristics of math thing are there in reality. Which is partially why math starts out often by just listing the defining features, and then using only those features and nothing else.

&gt;I'm a banking employee, and did a stint in our financial and accounting services division, the area of the bank that handles payments to the bank. This isn't specifically inter-customer transfers, but rather payments that the bank does to vendors or that vendors pay to the bank.

&gt;As has been noted in other comments in the thread, before payments go through there are several controls that need to be passed. Most of these are automated (checking if the account being paid into doesn't belong to an ISIS affiliate, seeing if someone with a $2000 salary isn't suddenly getting a $250,000 payment, etc). However, these still need to be manually approved by at least 3 different people (in our world). This doesn't mean that 3 different people are looking at your payment before clicking ""Accept"", but more that 3 different people are looking at a list of payments with all the details listed before batch loading them to the payment structure. They're just looking for anything that looks ""out of place""; so either big payments, irregular payments or maybe something weird like someone paying themselves 1 cent from a million different bank accounts. 99.99% of the time, they don't pick anything up because the computers have already picked up the problem, but that's not the point.

&gt;The point is that now one bank employee can't just grab money from wherever and dump it into whichever account they want. Requiring 3 randomly assigned people to perform the check ON TOP of the computerize system reduces the (mostly internal) fraud rate to a level that most banks can live with. In other words, their risk and insurance are low enough because of this that they are willing to risk it happening, weed out 3 bad apples with one stone and then moving on.

&gt;What this also ensures is that someone who hacks into the system over the weekend cannot automatically pay themselves a million bucks, go to cash machines to withdraw it all and the bank (and maybe even customers) sit with their thumbs up their assholes come Monday morning.

&gt;tl;dr: the actual payment doesn't require a multi-step human intervention. Preventing fraud, collusion or an inside job does."

But it doesn't translate directly to power or vehicle speed.

E.g. let's say you have a gas car with an engine that goes up to 5000 rpm. The thing is, it provides the most power at about, say 2500 rpm. So you want to keep the engine somewhere around those rpms.

Now the transmission comes in and it serves 2 main purposes:

1) to provide the most power onto the wheels. E.g. if you want to go uphil you may need more power even for low speed, just like on a bike. Even if your rpm goes outside the good zone.

2) so you (on manual trans) or the automatic can keep the engine near its most effective rpms. E.g. if you're cruising at 70 kph (~50 mph I think?), you're most likely in 4th gear on most cars. You can technically be in 3rd, where you'll get higher rpm, but you won't get anything extra out of it. In fact if you keep the engine in high rpm unnecessarily, you can blow the engine. Or on the other hand you can be in 5th or 6th, but you better downshift again if you need to accelerate or go uphill.

So, you upshift in these cases:

A) you're accelerating to a speed where lower gear is no longer effective

B) you don't need the power, e.g. going downhill

When you upshift, the rpm drops momentarily, and then it depends what you're doing. When you apply gas, rpm goes back up. How fast depends on the load. If your rpm is low and the load is high, the engine dies.

You downshift when:

A) need to go slower (e.g. entering a lower speed zone) while also applying brakes

B) going uphill, and your current gear isn't effective, i.e. either rpm is too low or you're losing speed

C) you're already cruising and want to accelerate rapidly: this will increase rpm and thus power, but not in an effective manner because the engine will be out of its comfort zone. Note you'll need to upshift again to keep up the acceleration.

When you downshift, rpm goes up momentarily. Then it depends on what you're doing. If you keep rpm too high, you may blow the engine, especially with low load."

That means there is CO2 dissolved into the liquid well beyond its normal capacity to hold it. The CO2 will slowly escape until it reaches an equilibrium, but under normal conditions, this doesn't all happen at once.

When you smack the bottle down, the bottle moves down very quickly. However, the liquid inside doesn't. This creates a vacuum under the liquid. This vacuum allows the CO2 in the bottle to dissolve out very quickly, helping to fill that vacuum. Then, as the liquid actually drops down, the CO2 will form a lot of bubbles, since it will essentially form clumps of gas in the liquid. This creates the rapid foaming.

As the light travels back and forth between the mirrors, it continually passes through the gain medium. When light passes through the gain medium, the medium *radiates* more light traveling in the same direction, which amplifies the light. This is called *stimulated emission*.

hmackdaddy,1625253829,ochbr6,"MCAT practice question: A well-sealed flask found in a laboratory is said to contain a 3 M solution of an unidentified compound. The solution is measured to be 2.5 L and to have a density of 2 g/mol. The molar mass of this compound is closest to: 

A. 15 g/mol

B. 67 g/mol

C. 150 g/mol

D. 667 g/mol

I have the answer, but my book does not have a very good explanation and further confused me. I understand that two important equations for this problem include density = mass/volume and molarity = mol solute/volume of solution. Where I am most confused is how these two are related enough to get molar mass of the compound. 

Thank you for your time!",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: General Chemistry: Molar Mass from Molarity &amp; Density,"'h3ubd4q', 'h3ubi68', 'h3uecpu', 'h3ueqek', 'h3uer4o', 'h3ufeod', 'h3ufh6o', 'h3ufw2f', 'h3ugfxd', 'h3ut6l2', 'h3wn7ii'",11,"In cases like these, you can use a process known as ""dimensional analysis"". Basically, you use the units, which I'll put in \[square brackets\], to figure out the proper mathematical relationship.

You know you have a 3 M solution, which means that you have 3 \[mols / liter\]. This is one area that might be the most of your confusion; molarity is defined per liter, not per arbitrary volume.

We can work backwards. You are interested in having \[grams / mol\] as the unit of your answer, so you have:

\[something\] = ? \[grams / mol\]

You currently only have mols in the numerator, but you can invert your given information to put mols in the denominator:

1/3 \[liters / mols\] \* \[something\] = ? \[grams / mol\]

Now you need a way to change liters into grams. To do this, you need to have a fraction that can put liters in the denominator and grams in the numerator. Here you use the given density (after converting it to L instead of mL):

1/3 \[liters / mols\] \* 2000 \[grams / liter\] = ? \[grams / mol\]

1/3 \[~~liters~~ / mols\] \* 2000 \[grams / ~~liter~~\] = ? \[grams / mol\]

1/3 \[~~liters~~ / mols\] \* 2000 \[grams / ~~liter~~\] = **666.7 \[grams / mol\]**

To help you think about what this means, since you know that you have three mols of your compound in every liter, you know that 1/3rd of a liter contains one mol (by inverting). You also know that one liter of your compound weighs 2000g. This method is over-estimating the molar mass of your compound, as it is including the contribution of the mass of the solute in the density figure, but that's a little beyond the scope of this. The 2.5 liters was a red herring. Hope this helps; dimensional analysis is incredibly useful!"

You usually print the parts and assemble them. Many things require some other bits like bolts, nuts, or are simply cheaper (or more rigid) to be combined with off-the-shelf parts. And metal bearings for example have less friction than printing moving parts.


But you *can* print moving parts in one go. E.g. pull-back cars. As long as the clearance is large enough and the used material is rigid enough.

Even some airline companies ""print"" complete engine parts (metal powder + laser sintering) that would traditionally would require welding or bolting multiple parts together.

During his and LBJ’s Presidency the Civil Rights Act was passed that aimed to enforce desegregation and protect civil rights and voting rights of minority populations. This was passed on a regional vs party line vote - for the most part northerners voted for it and southerners voted against, regardless of party affiliation. It was deeply unpopular among Southern Whites.

Nixon and his allies saw this as an opportunity to sever the South from the national Democratic Party and reached out to the Southern Whites sympathizing with their opposition to the CRA. This was successful (eventually) and realigned a lot of the South between LBJ’s election and Nixon’s election. In contrast the national Democratic Party moved solidly behind supporting the CRA and generally more liberal social policies that came with the new coalition.

This resulted in an almost complete inversion of the Electoral College from 1956 to 1964.

Once the GOP established their outreach to Southern Whites they didn’t pay much of a political price with northern white voters, so we’re able to keep challenging the Democrats in the North while still winning the Southern States. Nixon used this to almost completely sweep the entire 68 and 72 election.

Emotional_Writer,1625228322,oc8wc1,"Context: I started learning calculus (with some linear algebra which I'm better at) and found out about Galois theory, and I obsess over things I don't understand. I've lost a lot of sleep trying to understand even the ""simplest"" concepts in Galois theory, without any progress.

All the explanations I've read so far talk about how the algebraic expression of the roots have to belong to the same field (Galois field) to be solvable, but how is that actually determined and why does it prove anything about solvability, especially since most of what they express is (theoretically) already covered by the algebraic expressions themselves?

For example, the image on the Wikipedia page for Galois theory (can't copy the link fsr) shows sqrt(2), sqrt(6), and sqrt(3) so my guess is that because the operation of roots is division, the Galois field and Q need the containing the dividend over one of those roots that gives the other root as a quotient to adjoin Q and Gal - but I'm guessing that's wildly off-base given how complex a subject it's supposed to be.",explainlikeimfive,ELI5: what do Galois groups actually prove about solvability?,"'h3tdp15', 'h3tgq7d', 'h3tgs2k', 'h3tj88m', 'h3tmk6y', 'h3tz16t', 'h3u4i9k', 'h3u72zd', 'h3u7ji4', 'h3u8mu9', 'h3uajde', 'h3voejb', 'h3wmabk', 'h3woeoc', 'h3wovgf', 'h3wqbk0', 'h3wsjnx', 'h3x32my', 'h3x4ygb', 'h3x6jm2', 'h3x9yl8', 'h3xedpn', 'h3yptz7', 'h44zv13', 'h46em19'",25,"It is a bit complicated but let me try. First, there's two notions called ""solvability,"" one for polynomials and one for groups (I'll explain what groups are later). They'll turn out to be very intimately related, although it may not look like it from the get go. First let me explain the polynomial side of things, it might be a bit easier to grasp.

Ok, so start with a field (we usually take Q, so if you're not sure what the general definition of a field is, just picture rational numbers). You can ask yourself ""what's the smallest set containing Q and some real number that isn't in Q which has a coherent addition and multiplication such that all the ""nice"" properties hold (distributivity, commutativity, associativity, additive and multiplicative inverses)? For example, what's the smallest ""nice"" set (field) containing Q and sqrt(2)? Well, it turns out the best you can do is take all of Q and add all rational multiples of sqrt(2), so you end up with a set consisting of all rational numbers, all rational multiples of sqrt(2), and all possible sums of those. So, ½ is an element. So is 3/4xsqrt(2), and so is 4/435435+ 32/9sqrt(2). More generally, any element can be written as a+bsqrt(2), for a and b rational numbers. That set is written Q\[sqrt(2)\] (Q adjoin root 2). 

Now, I may want to solve a polynomial like x\^2 -2. The roots as you know are sqrt 2 and - sqrt 2, so they aren't rational. The smallest extension of the rational numbers in which I can find every single root is (in this case) Q\[sqrt(2)\]. That means that if I wanted to write that polynomial in factored form, the smallest place I could do it is in Q\[sqrt(2)\]. We say that this polynomial is ""solvable"" because I can write it in factored form in some extension of Q which I get to by adding roots. (There's nothing special about only adjoining root 2. I could adjoin any nth root of any rational number, and I could do that as many times as I want. So, something like Q\[sqrt(2), cube root(1252), sqrt(34564)\] is also a radical extension, and a polynomial which splits into linear factors in that extension would also be solvable). 

Now let's turn to group theory. A group is just a set of symmetries of something -- it's all the ways you can reorder a thing and preserve it in some way. For example, the set of reorderings of the numbers (1,2) is a group containing the elements ""do nothing"" and ""switch 1 and 2."" Certain groups have a property called ""solvability"" which is technical and seemingly unmotivated. Let's treat it as a black box. 

Now, Galois theory relates extensions like Q\[sqrt 2\] to groups in a very precise way. For each extension, you can find a unique polynomial which factors linearly over that extension \*and\* when you combine all the factors, you get a polynomial with coefficients in Q \*and\* is as small (low degree) as possible. In the Q\[sqrt 2\] example, that polynomial is x\^2-2 and it's called the minimal polynomial. The Galois group of the extension is the group which swaps all the roots of the minimal polynomial between each other (in a coherent way). For Q\[sqrt 2\], the Galois group is the group which can do 2 things: nothing, or swap sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), and leave everything else the same. What that means is that the group ""acts"" on the extension. Say I take the group element g which swaps the roots. Then I can apply that element to a random element a + b sqrt(2) of Q\[sqrt 2\]. Then g(a+bsqrt(2)) = a-b sqrt(2), because I switch the roots and leave everything else the same. 

If that group has the ""solvable"" property, then that polynomial is ""solvable"". Ie, I can write all of its roots in some extension of Q that I get to only by adding some nth roots. The same thing works in reverse: If I can solve a polynomial only by adding nth roots, then the galois group of that extension is solvable. If one of those conditions fails, then the other one must fail as well. 

What Galois showed is that every possible group associated to a field where the degree of the minimal polynomial is less than 5 is solvable, but that some groups bigger than that are not solvable. So that implies that every polynomial of degree &lt; 5 is such that every solution is a radical expression, but not every polynomial of degree &gt;= 5 satisfies that."

It likes to flow through some things better than it flows through other things.

An example is a nine-volt battery with the two little knots on the top. Electricity doesn't like air very much - it's an ""insulator"". But it LOVES many metals and it loves salty water. So if you lick that battery, the salt water on your tongue gives the electricity in the battery a little highway that it likes much better than air, so it jumps on and you get a shock.

And some things are way way better than others. A wire? Ooh, it hops RIGHT on board. But a human body? Well, you need a lot of electricity to overcome the resistance (level of insulation) before it'll go through your body. This is why your dry finger on that battery's top won't give you a shock, but putting a fork in an electrical outlet can electrocute you. (Note: please don't try this.)

So you hook up a ground wire to give the electricity a very convenient path to go along instead of through your body and what you're touching. So if you're a technician that's working on a computer circuit board on a dry day where there's carpet, you hook up a ""ground wire"" to connect yourself to a metal table, which has way less resistance than the path through the motherboard and tools you're using. Instead of a big static charge snapping through that board, like what happens when you scuff your sock feet and then touch a doorknob, the electricity follows the convenient low-resistance wire, and you don't damage your electronics when you take a screwdriver to them.

Ground wires in three-prong electrical cords are the same. In the event something goes wrong in a household appliance that's powered by electricity, the ground wire provides a way for the electricity to exit INSTEAD of your own body because that wire has lower resistance. 

Same thing for ""lightning rods"" on buildings - they provide a connection to the ground that is not the building itself, and a strike flows through the conducting wire rather than setting fire to the more resistant building."

You put a foam board behind it. You shoot a shotgun towards the slit. Each pellet is going to go through one slit, or through the other. The pellets are going to make dents in the foam board. When you look where the dents are, they are clustered behind each slit.

Now let's say you floated a barrier in a pool, and that barrier had two openings in it. You bob up and down on one side of the barrier to make waves. The waves leave your body in a circle and reach the openings in the barrier. On the other side of the barrier you see two sets of waves (that each look a bit like a wifi symbol). Those waves run into each other, and if you look at what the water is doing, some of it is going up and down twice as much (where the waves are ""both up"" or ""both down""), and some of the water surface is standing still (where one wave up meets the other wave down.) If you make a graph of wave height on the far side, it's stripey. We call that ""interference"".

The pellets behave like things the physicists call ""particles"". The water waves behave like things the physicists call ""waves"".

Now, if you do the experiment with light instead, and put photo film (or a sensor) on the far side of an obstacle with two slits in it, if light were a particle you would expects two peaks. If light were a wave you would expect stripes. The first interesting result is that you get stripes.

The second interesting result is if you dim the light source so extremely, that you are mathematically sure that only one photon at a time is traveling, YOU STILL GET STRIPES ON THE FILM.

So photons, traveling in isolation, still produce an interference pattern. That makes no sense at all, at the scale of water, or shotgun pellets. But at the quantum scale, weird things like this happen."

Once that's determined, the remainder of the QR code is a lot like binary, it's a grid of squares which are either filled or unfilled, like binary 1s and 0s (this is a simplification of the actual encoding mechanism which is quite complex and allows for a bunch of redundancy, which is why you often have a company logo over the QR Code, obscuring some of the grid, but it still works)

It was something everyone used to have, but MOST people evolved out of it and is now a leftover of evolution.

If all the rooms were full then they are full... It makes no sense if there are infinite rooms because there would be no way to fill the rooms up. Even if you put infinite people in it. It would just keep going. I have seen videos of that example. Well if everyone moves over one too. Then there would be another room to fill. Well no... Infinite rooms and infinite people are never ending so they can never be full. I really like your answer but I hate this hotel example I always see.

The Hotel example is a metaphor and all metaphors break down if you apply too much pressure. It admittedly takes a bit of suspension of conventional thinking to understand it.

The primary issue I see in complaints with the hotel (including yours) is (and correct me if I'm wrong) a tendency to focus on the practical, mechanical issues of how a stream of people coming in could ever fill up an infinite hotel, how they could all ever leave their rooms and move to new rooms, etc.

This is where the metaphor breaks down and we need to suspend conventional thinking. We simply have to take it as a given that A) the hotel is filled when we start and B) an infinite amount of people can fill an infinite amount of rooms.

The Hotel is primarily a tool for thinking about infinities in a mathematical sense, so this suspension of conventional thinking isn't really a problem. For example, even though it would take us time to perform a calculation (e.g. 5+3=8), it would be silly to suggest that time in any way is involved in the mathematical fact that the sum of 5 and 3 is 8. That is just a mathematical fact.

Likewise, even though we make think that time is an issue that prevents an infinite number of people from filling an infinite number of rooms, what we're talking about is the mathematical fact that we can have an infinite amount of things together in a collection which in which time plays no role; it's just a mathematical fact.

The same goes with heaving them leave a room and move to double that room. We think of carrying the operation out in the real world where that takes time and, as such, no such thing can happen (or at least finish). But again what we're talking about are mathematical facts, in this sense the fact that you can have an infinite set of numbers ({1, 2, 3...}) for which you can have an infinite set of double of each of those numbers ({2, 4, 6...})."

If your house depreciates too much, then the bank is in a situation where the collateral for the loan, the house, is worth less than the amount of money that is still owed for it \*and\* the amount they could sell it for if you didn't pay. The bank doesn't like to be in this situation, so a lot of the process of buying a house involves (or should involve) proving that the house is valued correctly and that you are situated to take care of the house with things like insurance.

The DA believed that there was no way to prosecute Cosby criminally for the assault due to lack of physical evidence and the only way to get any sort of justice was to have Cosby lose the civil case, so he issued a written agreement not to charge Cosby based upon his testimony in the civil case. This meant the Fifth Amendment no longer applied, so Cosby had to answer the questions or go to jail for contempt of court for refusing to answer. Cosby admitted to the assault in the civil case.

Well I believe that consciousness is merely a self-check mechanism on the brain, we have yet to really be able to do anything close to it on artificial hardware.

Like you have to be aware of yourself in order to decide whether or not your current actions are consistent with your past actions. You also have to care of course.

To date we're not capable of creating a sense of really anything inside of a computer. We can tell an AI system to refer to itself as I, but we can't make it mean it.

When I'm writing science fiction I refer to our current level of rules based and neural network based systems as being ""coded intelligences"" in that all they really follow some particular code path that could be 100% predicted from the data inputs.

Artificial intelligence would be a higher order thing that could be aware of itself.

Now strict ""deterministic simulationists"", as in people who think we don't have free will ourselves because we are simply a product of our inputs and outputs, would not draw this distinction at all and would simply say we have not developed sufficiently powerful machines yet because all we are is powerful machines.

I'm not discussing a soul here in any way or anything extra physical...

But one of the things we are is machines that are capable of retrospection, and forgetfulness, and truly random processes.

The machines we can build are not capable of those three things to date.

The core reason is the machines cannot develop opinions. And I believe that opinion is the core of all thought. Indeed the heavy particle of thought is that do not want. I do not want to die. I do not want to starve. I do not want to sound stupid. And so forth. The lighter desires are changeable. I do not want to starve and surrounded by I like pizza, no pizzas available how about Italian food, none of that either how about a hot dog?

The myth of the uncaring machine is, in my personal opinion as a professional in the field, what is truly holding us back from developing AI. We want to model a perfectly reasonable intellect, but I don't believe there is such a thing possible. The mere fact that an intellect will choose between ""I am fine"" and ""I are fine"" and deliberately pick the one that sounds less stupid even though the verb and tenses are identical indicates the function of preference inherent in our entire existence.

And think about how we develop, we start as bundle of avoidances. Cry cuz I'm hungry. Cry cuz I'm dirty. Cry cuz I'm lonely. cry because there's something I want to have not be true anymore.

And every intelligence we've been able to detect in nature is also driven first by desire and need long before analysis.

To properly simulate an intelligence we would need to properly simulate need and opinion, and you've seen how terrible we are and even understanding those two things as human beings let alone properly modeling them in a computer.

So called neural networks sort of learn to match the expectations, but they don't actually have a need to please, basically as we train them we simply say good neural net or bad neural net but the good and the bad don't mean anything to the neural net other than let's tweak the variables in that direction or not.

I don't think it's an insoluble problem, but we have to stop thinking about lieutenant commander data, and Colossus the forbidden project, and the fact that the stereotype of the uncaring machine referred to giant pulleys and flywheels that could grind a person to death without even slowing down, so we shouldn't treat it as a moral judgment about the value of caring."

Conditions that will give rise to that level of disorder are usually things like schizophrenia that cannot be controlled through medication, mental retardation to the point that the person has the mental capacity of a small child, or autism to the degree that the person cannot care for themselves.

When people have a condition so severe that they're an invalid, the legal system will step in to supervise their lives.  The way this works is that a judge appoints another person, typically a close relative, who is then given complete control over the invalid's life. 

That means that the conservator makes essentially every major decision in the invalid's life.  This can range from financial decisions to what they're going to do every day.

Britney Spears has an undisclosed, serious psychological disorder.  The only thing that is publicly known about this disorder is that she has been involuntarily committed on several occasions, despite being medicated.  Many people have surmised that she has an extremely severe form of schizophrenia but ultimately the only people that know are the people involved with the court case.

On the basis of her undisclosed condition, the Los Angeles County Court has placed her under a conservatorship.

People are used to having a lot of information about the lives of celebrities because most of what they do is in the open.  We know about Britney Spear's conservatorship because the conservatorship is overseen by the Los Angeles County Court and the existence of the case itself is public information.  What is not public information is everything else related to it.  The hearings are closed and the documents related to it are sealed.

Every few years the judge in the case has ordered Britney Spears to undergo a psychological evaluation to determine if the conservatorship is necessary.  Since the conservatorship has been renewed, we can surmise that the evaluation has determined that it is, in fact, necessary given her condition.  The only reason we know about these evaluations is because Britney Spears has revealed them.  She has not revealed anything else, including what her condition is.  There is almost certainly a reason for that.

These conservatorships are not granted or maintained easily.  To be placed under one - particularly when you're someone as high profile as Britney Spears is - you really need to have a condition that is so serious that you cannot function on your own.  Again, Britney Spears could release all of the information about what's going on.  She hasn't.  That pretty much tells you all you need to know."

Fossil fuel automobiles can convert about 25% (the very most efficient is just over 30%) of the energy to movement of the vehicle, the rest is waste heat - mostly out the tail pipe.

A fossil fueled power plant can convert over 60% of the fossil fuel energy into electricity\*.

Electric motors can be about 90% efficient at converting the electricity to movement.

So if all electric power for all electric cars was generated by (modern) fossil fueled power plants the overall efficiency would be about 40%. A 60% improvement over fuel efficient automobiles - that is a huge difference. Or a 150% improvement over the average gasoline powered car on the road today which has about 16% thermal efficiency.

100% fossil fuel \* 60% power plant efficiency \* 93% power grid efficiency \* 90% battery charging efficiency \* 90% motor controller efficiency \* 90% motor efficiency = 40% overall efficiency for an electric car powered by fossil fuel generated electricity.

\----------

\*Roughly 1/3 of electrical generation in the USA is from coal (which is \~33% efficient), 1/3 is from natural gas which is about 50% efficient if you average the different types of natural gas plants (which range from 40% to  more than 60% efficient depending upon how modern the equipment is). That makes for an average fossil fuel thermal efficiency of about 44% in the USA, generating 66% of all electrical power.

Renewable energy (including nuclear) in the USA makes up the other third which for this example we consider to be 100% efficient - since it is carbon neutral. Average these all together and the overall electrical energy generating efficiency in the USA is about 61%. With modernization that number will climb."

The problem with answering this question is that these methods are obviously obfuscated by design. The even bigger issue is that it’s constantly evolving so there are probably dozens of applicable answers. It’s also evolving in multiple ways; the natural evolution of technology and the cat and mouse game of figuring out how to break it, figure out how they broke it, repeat. 

Modern copy protection like denuvo is infinitely more complex then the basic checks outlined above, probably. There’s some info on how it works out there but it’s very inconsistent and usually anything remotely specific is posted anonymously because obviously denuvo doesn’t want you to know how it works. Based on what I’ve read it involves a custom virtual machine that uses an obfuscated instruction set to make decompilation more difficult.

Because human skin is moist, both through sweat and through normal skin moisture, wet bulb temperature controls the temperature reached by human skin. That, in turn, determines how hot it *feels* and how hard your body has to work to get rid of excess heat. So how dangerous heat is to you depends on the wet bulb - not the dry bulb - temperature.

The relationship between the two is shown on a chart called a psychrometric chart. [Here's an example of how to use it](https://i.imgur.com/84iGefF.png). Suppose a dry thermometer reads 35 C (95 F). It's relatively dry, say, 40% humidity. You find the dry bulb temperature along the bottom of the chart, and find the humidity curve that arcs down along it (in black in the image). Then you find the wet bulb line that runs through where they intersect (purple) - in this case, about 23 C wet bulb. That's uncomfortably warm but not life-threatening - it's the equivalent of a very humid 23 C / 74 F. 

To try it yourself, suppose you have a 30 C (86 F) day at 70% humidity - what's your wet bulb? (You should get about 26 C, meaning that 30 C + 70% humidity *feels* hotter [and is more dangerous than] than 35 C + 40% humidity.)"

That is incorrect. Earth's electromagnetic field is commonly referred to as the geomagnetic field. Schuman Resonance is a different thing, a global electromagnetic resonance phenomenon.

The basic idea is that the surface of the Earth and the ionosphere can act as waveguides, restricting the movement of electromagnetic energy in some direction. When lightning happens the discharge can bounce around between the two, and there are some frequencies it preferentially maintains. Think like how a bell rings a certain tone or a drum vibrates a certain speed.

&gt;	it varies it's frequency from day to day

The condition of the ionosphere along with the amount and location of lightning varies over time, meaning the resonance can be expected to change as well.

&gt;	And how it affects humans?

**It doesn’t.** The strength of this resonance is significantly lower than the regular electromagnetic variation in the weather, the sort which in greater amounts can result in lightning. The static electricity formed by a slight breeze doesn’t really mean anything for humans and this resonance is even less impactful than that."

1. Crabs are small. Burrowing crabs are particularly small. Since your strength depends on the square-cube law, it means crabs are relatively strong.
2. Crabs are built to live underwater. They're already adapted to having large amounts of pressure on their body, as long as that pressure is fairly even.
3. The sand the crab is buried in helps distribute the weight. Some of your weight spreads outwards (thus not affecting the crab), while some of your weight pushes back inwards on the crab's sides (helping support the crab's body from the reduced weight from above). With the pressure now being more even, the crab's bits don't really have anywhere to go, and so stay put, un-crushed."

At 60 frames per second it had less than half the time to catch any blurring, so it doesn't. It ends up really crisp.

It seems like if your eyes are blurring actual movement then it should blur these too when you watch it, but they don't, because you aren't watching actual movement; you're watching 60 still images being shot at your eyes every second, and your brain interprets that differently.

Back in the early days of Pixar, before they made movies, they demoed some ground breaking animation techniques at a technical conference, and one of them was a plugin to artificially introduce motion blur into their frames. Animated films with this adjustment would probably look fine at 60 fps.

I couldn't find the original footage; I saw it back in school. But based on this article:

It’s the difference in those conditions that causes the difference in applications.  You can make a fission reactor by putting some special rocks in a tube and using them to boil water.  To make a fusion reactor you have to fake being inside of a star.  Which is hard to do if you want to do it more than once."

The party was very strong in the South, which was a minority of the party but an important and reliable voting bloc. The Southern Democrats were strongly in favor of segregation. They used their influence to stop Civil Rights being introduced in the Democratic Party platform--besides withholding votes in Congress, they threatened to run their own presidential candidates instead of the one endorsed by the party. Several times they had actually made good on the threat by fielding a separate candidate who won states in the South. In 1960, Harry Byrd got 15 electoral votes; in 1968, Henry Wallace got 46.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 saw the federal government interfering with schools, local businesses and the like in ways that were controversial even if you weren't in favor of Jim Crow laws. Lyndon Johnson's presidency likewise saw huge increases in government spending on social programs. Furthermore, increases in crime and social strife in the '60s was blamed on the Democrats. Nixon and Goldwater took advantage of the stress in the Democratic Party by taking the closest position to the Southern Democrats that could still be acceptable in the mainstream: they were not for segregation, but they opposed the specific things the Democrats wanted the federal government to do against it.

The Democratic Party in the long run decided to focus more on Civil Rights even if it meant abandoning their support in the South. So Southern Southern voters did what was logical: some voted for Wallace, depriving Democrats of those electoral votes, and others decided to vote for the candidate that promised them the next-best thing and actually had a chance of winning, Nixon. It helped win him the presidency. Over time, segregation itself became a dead issue, and when pro-segregation Democrats died or retired the seat often became filled by a Republican."

Near the horizon, light from space has to go through a lot more atmosphere to get to you. The atmosphere is better at scattering short wavelength light than long wavelength. 

You can kind of think of short wavelength lights (having more peaks and troughs) as bouncing off of more atoms because it's so wavy, if you'd like. Meanwhile, long wavelength can weave between them better. (This is **not at all** how it actually works, but it helps me visualize it).

Anyway, light from the sun (and reflected light from the sun from Venus) is white light, made up of a bunch of wavelengths.

The shorter wavelengths, like blue, get scattered around, largely back into space.

The longer wavelengths, like red, get through all of that extra atmosphere and into your eye."

From a practicality stand point there's absolutely no reason to re-invent the wheel every few years on OS's when all of those updates could be free updates.

Releasing new OSs every few years is really nothing more than a cash grab to force people to constantly upgrade. It's the same reason the license on your PC can't be transferred to another PC.

The technical term for this is planned obsolescence. Deliberately making your own product obsolete in order to force your user base to buy the newer version.

But on the flip side the revenue generated by this is what pays for the very new features in that OS. That money needs to come from somewhere and the alternative is a subscription based model or open source.

As for the GUI redesign a lot of it is a fallacy. Changing the design and interface is part trying to attract new users, part refreshing to make things look new and exciting and chasing trends, and part change for the sake of change. But there's also wisdom in ""Don't change what isn't broke""."

Yes.  The more you walk barefoot, you develop SOME callouses and become less sensitive.  (I’m perms-barefooted where possible and my feet are more muscular and padded but not particularly calloused)

More importantly, you walk differently. 

People wearing shoes are clumsy and heavy footed and walk by picking up their feet and falling forward with all of their weight step after step, directly on the heel. (Additionally, cushioned shoes INCREASE the amount of force you hit the ground with. They’ve done studies where people run on a treadmill with and without shoes and people wearing shoes hit the ground with twice as much force just to be able to feel the ground.  Think about having to shout to be heard by someone with ear plugs)

If you go barefooted, you learn to PLACE your feet before putting weight on them.  You put your foot down, and if there’s rock or pointy stuff underneath, you put more weight on your toes or your heels or wherever is suitable. 

Do it for a few years and it takes no thought.  You take slightly shorter steps, place your feet on the ground and then ease weight onto it.  

Yes.  If you go barefooted and pretend you’re wearing heavy boots, you’re only one step away from stone bruises and other pain.

But otherwise, being barefooted increases your connection to the ground and lessens the impact of your footfall on the ground and your joints.  

As far as running, you still “place” your feet. Being barefoot, the speed at which your brain communicates with the bottom of your feet is infinitely faster and more detailed. You just run much lighter. You make more gentle contact on dangerous ground and retrieve the foot faster if you find sharp rocks or hostile ground.  Not every step is a full step where all of your weight lands.  Often times you have some half steps or hop steps where don’t commit your weight to the ground if the foot falls on a pointy rock.  

Think of it like trying to read Braille while wearing oven mitts.  There’s a world of information most people never make contact with by wearing shoes.    Most people’s feet are so horribly sensitive because the feet are supposed to be every bit as sensitive as hands but people swaddle them and stick them inside of marshmallows their whole life. 

If you’re really interested in this stuff, look up a book called “Born to Run” by someone McDougal. 

Edit: added references.
Edit: I think my biggest grievance with people saying “calluses” is that it’s a bad thought process.   People saying “calluses” insinuate that we naturally develop “shoes” if we don’t have shoes.  Like the fact that feet are soft and sensitive is a mistake. Evolution wouldn’t have left all those nerve endings down there if they were a mistake.   If we were supposed to have hooves, we’d have hooves.    The problem isn’t soft feet.  It’s clumsy modern  humans that never learned how to develop a relationship with the surface we live on."
