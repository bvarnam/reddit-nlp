ChrisGnam,1630428742,pf9tvb,"So most of my peers (26 y/o and older) don't have a ""favorite color"".  I've personally always found this odd because for me, red is very clearly the ""best"" color.  And I dont mean that as its the color I personally like best from an aesthetic point of view.  The best way I can describe it is that I can almost perceive red better than I can another color like blue.  It just seems so much more vivid.  

I've taken color blindness tests and what not and I believe I have ""normal"" color vision.  But I swear that the color red just always feels, in a sense, more real to me.

This came up with some friends recently when a scene in a movie came on where one character asked the other what their favorite color was.  He quipped back blue, and the original character pointed thats a lie because adults don't really have a favorite color.  It struck me as almost odd, and in talking with my friends more, I was surprised they didn't feel the same way as me.  

So I suppose my question really is...  are there any physiological or psychological differences that can cause someone to perceive a color very differently from other colors?  Or is this purely something I've somehow only imagined?",askscience,Are there physiological or psychological differences that can cause people to perceive colors very differently?

anxiouspolygon,1629454787,p82f2j,"tldr: Are we still prying melatonin out of mammalian pineal glands and placing it in supplements or has this practice effectively ended? I think the risks associated with doing this are substantial, but there is poor oversight in some jurisdictions where melatonin is OTC, and I'm not sure what to believe about this.

Melatonin is found in a bunch of places: certain plants contain it, it can be synthesized from tryptophan, and of course it is contained in the pineal glands of mammals. Apparently, some melatonin supplements are derived from the pineal glands of cattle. This is worrisome, there are all kinds of risks associated with consuming this kind of thing and among those risks is CJD, the most common prion disease in humans. 

What I would like to know is whether this is still a common practice, and if not, when exactly did we stop doing this? All I can find on this topic is a few vague statements in various places along the lines of ""most melatonin is synthetic now,"" but this doesn't seem convincing to me. Adding to my skepticism is the fact that the quality among OTC melatonin supplements has been demonstrated to be terrible, with huge inconsistencies between stated dosages and actual dosages contained within the pills. I would not be surprised if all of the OTC melatonin continues to be produced in this very risky way given the very poor quality control. A convincing counterargument would be that synthetic melatonin is cheaper to produce than the animal-derived kind, but I have no way of estimating the margins either way here.

HGH derived from cattle brains has caused CJD in children who were administered it. This is a very real risk with melatonin as well if it is still being produced non-synthetically, hence my question. I'm not really sure that this question has a definitive answer, nobody can speak for every single supplement out there, so I suppose I'm asking more about the likelihood that this practice is widespread.",askscience,Is most melatonin produced synthetically?

123zxcfgh,1624051308,o30ktt,"Hi!
I've looked all over for an answer to this question, but can't seem to find an answer online that clarifies things for me. When describing the action potential, and the electrochemical gradient that forms it, I often see an ion as described as flowing down its respective concentration gradient. For example, during depolarization, sodium flows into the cell, from an area of high concentration to low concentration (of sodium). During depolarization, the same occurs, with potassium flowing out of the cell. All through selective ion channels of course.

My first issue is, how are these individual gradient physically justifiable? Isn't diffusion determined by the overall concentration of ions (since they are bouncing off each other and creating a ""pressure"" that is lower in an area of lower concentration)? Wouldn't the overall osmolarity be the only relevant factor?

My second issue come from what's probably a bad assumption. I did a bit of searching and found that the extracellular fluid has a higher osmolarity then the intracellular fluid in a neuron. That combined with the difference in charge of -70mV sort of explains the depolarization step and its eventual charge of +30mV. As part of the energy is derived from the difference is concentration, and the rest a difference in charge, I can see why depolarization would be spontaneous. It also explains to me why it ""overshoots"" and another +30mV of charge are produced across the membrane, as additional energy from the resolution of the concentration difference is ""stored"" as a positive electrical potential. My next issue is, if depolarization is spontaneous (based off of the assumption I made above), how does hyperpolarization occur to restore the membrane potential to an EVEN HIGHER negative voltage. How could this be spontaneous? With the lower osmolarity inside the cell, this makes little to no sense to me. I thought the energy might have come from the ATPase pumps in the cell membrane, but I've read that hyperpolarization is so fast, these cannot explain the restoration of the electrochemical gradient.

revblaze,1623940716,o1ytft,"One point that I've read constantly is the fact that this asteroid just so happened to hit a concentrated sulfur reserve – which, upon impact, was vaporized instantly – causing the fallout to cloud the entire Earth and forcing upon it a new ice age.

Based on this [kurzgesagt video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFCbJmgeHmA), the reasoning given for why the larger marine animals became extinct was due to 97% of all plankton – the bottom foundation of the aquatic food chain – being killed off.

I tried Googling this and couldn't come across any research papers or discussions on the topic: **Had the asteroid hit somewhere else on the planet (ie. not a sulfur reserve), could the outcome of the K-T extinction been very different?**

Some additional thoughts that stemmed from this question:

* Had it hit somewhere else on the planet, could the impact – and the events that followed – have been more or less devastating?
* What were the chances that the asteroid impact could've been less destructive (and possibly not brought on the series of disastrous events that followed)?
* Had the asteroid not hit the sulfur reserve that caused a cloud of darkness around Earth, would the Earth have eventually been able to cool itself?
   * How much longer would this stage have lasted (vs. the relatively quick period of the cooling brought on by fallout)?
* Could the **lack of** a cloud that covered the Earth been potentially more devastating to life in the long run?
   * ie. Earth is stuck in a premoridial-type state for a longer period of time, stunting evolution's ability to grow more diverse life.

What were the chances that this asteroid just so happened to hit where it did and cause a devastating chain of events that killed off most of the land-based species, as well as the marine life that followed soon after?

I understand that an aeroplane's wings generate lift by making the air travel a greater distance on top than on the bottom in the same amount of time, effectively increasing air velocity on the top, making for a lower pressure relative to the air pressure on the bottom.

I also know that at too high an angle of attack coupled with too low an airspeed, the air separates from the top surface of the wing.

Part of me understand that if there is no airflow, and therefore no faster airflow and lower pressure, on the top of the wing, lift will decrease. However, at the same time, if the plane is moving forward and the air is failing to make contact/follow the top surface, would that not in effect be creating sort of a vacuum would be at an even lower pressure than if there was fast airflow? Would that not in itself create more lift?

I addition, I know that gold balls aren't smooth because a smooth surface would cause the airflow to not follow the surface around the ball far enough back. This results in the trailing-side of the ball having a very low pressure which greater accentuates the force acting against the direction of the ball. Would this not apply to an aeroplane's wings, where the top of the wing is analogous to the trailing-side of a smooth golf ball?

As far as the sciences go, this is less of a hard science question than it is a soft science question for the most part (as in, relating to things like anthropology, sociology, etc.), though there's probably a physics application to the question too since we're talking with different frames of reference with regard to time.

Sci-Fi stories with multiple planets still do the ""X years/months/weeks later"" transition, even though planets of different sizes and rotations would have different calendars and would measure time differently. Considering the delivery of things like messages, goods, etc. is important--vital, even--for the functioning of a stable society, and since these things are all dependent on a common understanding of time, how would this actually work when entirely different yearly calendars and day cycles are used?

Like, I can't wrap my mind around it. The closest point of comparison I can think of is the delivery of packages across different time zones here on Earth, which would mean that time zone differences would need to be taken into account, but that's just on a scale of hours and minutes, which are the same for everywhere. When you're talking travel to other planets, which have day/night cycles of varying hours which are different from Earth's 24-hour cycle, to say nothing of the adjustment of their respective calendars which could have more or less months than Earth itself, and that's not even getting into the ***seasons,*** let alone the fact that time would also be measured differently during the trip in space due to relativity.

So how would we keep it consistent? What system would we use? It seems like a small thing, but considering the non-zero possibility of humanity leaving Earth to form permanent settlements elsewhere due to either exploration or lack of resources (assuming the species doesn't eradicate itself first), this strikes me as a pretty huge logistical problem (at least, as long as we're assuming that human society is continuous across the solar and extra-solar colonies--I suppose that if each planet were isolationist and kept to themselves, this would be far less of an issue).

I’m in the J&amp;J 2-shot COVID vaccine clinical trial. (It’s double blinded, so I don’t know whether I got the real vaccine or a control placebo.) I just got my second shot today. One of the things the nurses said, both times I got a shot, is that if my arm was sore right after the shot, it’s more likely that it’s the real vaccine.

It could be psychosomatic, of course, but I’m still curious, why does the shot hurt more when it’s real? Is it just because the body’s immune response is *that* fast? I figured the pain was a normal response to the skin being pierced and to having a shot, but if that’s the case then both the real deal and the control would hurt the same amount.

Vrindjes,1614416202,ltk3dx,"Sorry for the long list. Once I started reading up about radon and cancer, more questions kept popping up. I'm hoping somebody here is in the know and can answer some!


1. If radon is radioactive, and leaves radioactive material in your body, why does it mainly (only?) cause lung cancer?


2. If radon is 8x heavier than air, and mostly accumulates in the basement, wouldn't that mean that radon is a non-issue for people living on higher levels?


3. [This map](https://www.env.go.jp/en/chemi/rhm/basic-info/1st/02-05-07.html) shows radon levels around the world. Why is radon so diverse across a small continent like Europe, yet wholly consistent across a massive country like Russia? Does it have to do with measuring limitations or architecture, or is the ground there weirdly uniform? 


4. If radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking, why doesn't the  [map](https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/28/10/1563.figures-only)of worldwide lung cancer cases coincide with the map of most radon heavy countries?  It seems to coincide wholly with countries that smoke heavily and nothing else. I base this one the fact that if you look at second chart, which is lung cancer incidence in females, the lung cancer cases in some countries like Russia, where smoking is much more prevalent among men, drop completely. Whereas lung cancer rates in scandinavia, far and away the most radon heavy place on earth, are not high to begin with.

However it is almost always on my right side! I’ve also had two pregnancies with early scans that confirmed I had ovulated off the right side to conceive them.

There have been many times when I see someone and in my head I think they have a “common” face, as in, they share a lot of features and/or a similar composition of those features to a lot of other people I’ve seen. I don’t recognise the person, or think they look average. It’s that they just have ‘one of those faces’ that I see a lot.

 I’m wondering if this is actually a thing that has been studied on a genetic level, whether certain sequences of dna are more typical than others, or if it may be more or a neurological thing related to how I process faces and interpret/recognise them.

But from my understanding, SARS-CoV-2 attack vector is the upper respiratory system, where it enters our body from floating droplets in our airways through the nose and mouth.  The droplets then settle on the tissue inside of our airways and the infection begins there.  Is my visualization of how that works correct?

If such is the case, the virus is initially hitting ""exterior"" cells, because it is touching the cells that line your airway, so they are hitting a ""wall"" of cells in your nose and throat and beyond that wall is just a cavity filled with air.

So how do the antibodies neutralize the virus in this situation?  If the virus is not ""inside"" our body floating around in our blood stream.

It says:

Therefore, the higher the carrier frequency, the greater the signal bandwidth. That’s why, among the millimeter-wave frequencies, 28 GHz and 60 GHz are the most promising frequencies for 5G. The 28 GHz band can provide an available spectrum bandwidth of up to 1 GHz, while each channel in the 60 GHz band can provide an available signal bandwidth of 2 GHz (a total available spectrum of 9 GHz divided between four channels).  

I'm assuming this is in the context of frequency modulation.

owlrabbitfox,1605729741,jwn6bt,"I asked this question on a question thread in r/COVID19, but I'm curious about viruses and immunity in general, not just COVID.

To shed more light on my question, I have a friend who tested positive for COVID antibodies over the summer (after presumably having an asymptomatic case at some point), had many negative tests over the past several months, and then tested positive for COVID on a PCR test again a couple weeks ago. Both times she was asymptomatic. Could this mean that the immune system is doing exactly what it’s supposed to do — i.e. the second time she got exposed, her body recognized the virus, fought it off, and she was never actually infectious? **That is, I assume “immunity” doesn’t actually prevent the virus from** ***entering*** **your body, but rather your immune system recognizes it and knows how to properly respond.** So can you have a true positive in this case because the virus has managed to make it into your system again and PCR tests are overly sensitive and will pick up on even a miniscule trace of virus? To get ahead of an answer I've already gotten: she has had many negative PCR tests between the positive antibody test and this most recent PCR test (she's someone who tests periodically as a precaution) so it seems less likely to me that this is one of those cases of someone consistently testing positive for months due to viral remnants.

That all said: **COVID aside, how does this work in a broad sense?** We don't test as frequently or with such high sensitivity for other viruses, but if we did, could an immune or vaccinated person theoretically have a virus ""in their system"" at a level high enough to test positive for it on a molecular test, but not be symptomatic or infectious because their body already knows how to fight it?

So would the antigens produced also compete for ACE2? A concern is that they could block ACE2 from receiving its natural ligand, which might cause heart issues, as seen with Covid-19. Is this possible and how are they dealing with it? 

A possibility I thought would be a small enough dosage of mRNA to produce just enough spike proteins, but without producing significant competition to the natural ligand. 

Can anyone clarify/confirm on this? 

Also, the spike protein is a fusion type protein, so when the vaccine produced antigen attaches to ACE2 on cells, would it still illicit the same fusion response? Obviously there wouldn’t be another membrane to fuse with but would it cause the membrane to become porous? 

A possibility I thought about is if the mRNA codes for a mutated spike protein that does not cause fusion process, yet can still be recognized and used to cause an immune response by T cells. Or maybe the mRNA only codes for the S1 subunit of the spike protein, preventing the s2 fusion part? But then would T cells still be able to cause the desired immune response?

With the exciting news about the mRNA vaccine efficacy I wanted to better understand how the vaccine type works - especially since it hasn't been used in humans before. Specifically I wanted to know if there is a reasonable chance for long term harm that wouldn't be caught in the initial studies during the pandemic.

My understanding is the mRNA makes its way into your cells and the cells manufacture a protein unique to the virus (in this case the spike protein). This protein is then presented on the surface of your cells and then an immune cell comes along and checks it. The immune cell will recognize the protein as foreign, assume (incorrectly?) that the host cell is infected / cancerous and tell it to kill itself.

So, my question is, assuming the above is a mostly accurate representation of how the vaccine works, should we be concerned that we are training the immune system to kill otherwise healthy cells?",askscience,Could mRNA vaccines cause auto-immune disorders?

Why do I ask: I'm overweight, I started to exercise regularly since spring and dropped about 9 kg/19 pounds so far. Such tasks like going upstairs or running are much easier now, but my weight is still above the norm for my age/height. So I wonder if I've lowered the risk of getting the severe form of covid-19.

aggasalk,1601311014,j1ffed,"Wife and I had a long, weird argument last night about how siphons work. She didn't understand at all, and I only vaguely do (imagine what that argument was like). But at the end of the debate, I was left with a new question.

If I fill a cup with water in a tub, turn it upside down, and raise it out of the water, keeping the rim submerged, the water doesn't fall out of the cup. My understanding is, the water is being pulled down by gravity, but can't fall because there's nothing to take its place, and it takes a lot of energy to create a vacuum, so the water is simply being held up by the cup, and is exerting some kind of negative pressure on the inside of the cup. When I make a hole in the cup, air can be pulled in to take its place in the cup, so the water can fall.

If I did this experiment in a vacuum, I figure something very similar would happen. The water would be held in the cup until I made a hole, then it would fall into the tub. If anything, the water will fall a little faster, since it doesn't need to do any work to pull air into the cup through the hole. But then it seems that the vacuum is coming in to fill the space, which sounds wrong since the vacuum isn't a thing that moves.

I'm missing something in all of this. Vacuum isn't like air, it doesn't rush in through the hole in the cup to take the place of the water, allowing the water to fall.

I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

AskScienceModerator,1591120666,gvc7k9,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. 

When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.

When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.

These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. 

Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. 

However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.

These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.

This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.

It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.

cazzipropri,1590076969,gnzjxx,"I need help from someone who knows aerodynamics well, in connection with aerodynamics study material that all student pilots are asked to learn, specifically how the lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio varies as a function of airspeed.

The basic idea is to give the pilot an intuition of the fact that lift grows quadratically with airspeed, and so (somewhat) does drag, but there's a component of drag (induced) that grows a lot if you fly slow. For this reason, total drag exhibits a U-shaped plot, and the airspeed corresponding to the butt of the U is a sweet spot that gives you best range. That's the airspeed you should fly at for best economy, and the airspeed to establish in case of engine loss, to achieve best glide distance. If you fly faster, you glide less, and if you also fly slower, you also glide less.

More specifically, Most ground schools, including official FAA sanctioned material, present the same or very similar airspeed-drag charts, all having airspeed in knots on the x axis, and arbitrary drag units on y. They all plot parasite, induced, form (sometimes) and total drag curves. (Total drag D is the sum of parasite, induced and form drag.) Here is an example: [https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/alc/course\_content\_popup.aspx?cID=104&amp;sID=448](https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/alc/course_content_popup.aspx?cID=104&amp;sID=448)

They consistently make the claim that **the airspeed maximizing L/D is also the one that minimizes total drag**.

Note: they don't say that the two airspeeds (the one maximizing L/D and the one minimizing D) are **close enough** that we can confound them. No, they say they are the same. 

I'm a weekend pilot with a background in engineering and a day job in a quantitative field, and this claim bothers me. I played around for five minutes with a graphic calculator and plugged in simple functions that look close enough to those in the abstract plots:

* DI = Induced drag = 1/(500v)
* DF = Form Drag = 5 + 1/100 (v-45)\^2
* DP = Parasite Drag = 1/200 v\^2
* L = Lift = 1/5 v\^2
* D = Total Drag = DI+DF+DP

Of course, empirical experiments confirm my intuition that there's no chance in hell that argmax(L(v)/D(v)) matches argmin(D(v)).

Am I right? Am I wrong?

Of course the FAA's goal is not to teach physics, it's rather to give pilot simplified, actionable intuition that is mostly physically correct and that inspires the right in-flight decision.

ISkipLegDayAMA,1586625524,fzaa8w,"Looking at [this](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) data for reference.

From the end of March (roughly 2 weeks after more aggressive quarantine measures were put in place) until now, however, the cases appear to grow almost linearly with time.

What is the cause/explanation for why a virus would have a linear growth with time? An exponential growth I understand, and is typical of unmitigated spreading.

So I've been watching a lot of videos on youtube about the final stages of massive stars and the resultant cataclysmic space kablooie that follows. The final stages of successively fusing heavier elements, coupled with representing them as discrete shells, and then how the ultimate giant ball of Fe collapses, sits with me odd for some reason. Or rather, how it's depicted? Are coexistent shells the best way to illustrate it? Like is there really a clear and distinct boundary between regions where different elements fuse? Rather than ""this fuses and then this fuses and then this fuses"" aren't they all kind of going simultaneously? Or does the star have to get compact enough to get hot enough to move on to fusing the next element? And then my final question: is the collapse symmetrical? It gets presented as an all at once, from all directions, thing. But does fusion and the gravity fighting energy it produces really cease everywhere all at once? Is it effectively everywhere? Or is the collapse not symmetric and you can get things like directional supernovae that shoot out in one direction first, or more prominently, or where the energy waves interfere with one another in a cool pattern or something?

---

**COVID-19**

First, we wanted to talk about COVID-19. The mod team and all of our expert panelists have been working overtime to address as many of your questions as we possibly can. People are understandably scared, and we are grateful that you view us as a trusted source of information right now. We are doing everything we can to offer information that is timely and accurate. 

With that said, there are some limits to what we can do. There are a lot of unknowns surrounding this virus and the disease it causes. Our policy has always been to rely on peer-reviewed science wherever possible, and an emerging infectious disease obviously presents some major challenges. Many of the questions we receive have been excellent, but the answers to them simply aren't known at this time. As always, we will not speculate. 

We are also limiting the number of similar questions that appear on the subreddit. Our panelists are working hard to offer in-depth responses, so we are referring people to similar posts when applicable. 

To help, we have compiled a few /r/AskScience resources:

- [The COVID-19 FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/medicine/2019-ncov): This is part of our larger FAQ that has posts about a multitude of topics. We are doing our best to update this frequently.

- [COVID-19 megathread 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ewwmem/have_a_question_about_the_2019_novel_coronavirus/) and [COVID-19 megathread 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/etkdx1/coronavirus_megathread/): Lots of questions and answers in these threads.

- [New COVID-19 post flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27covid-19%27&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on): We've added a new flair category just for COVID-19. You can filter on this to view only posts related to this topic. We are currently re-categorizing past posts to add to this. 

- We will continue to bring you new megathreads and AMAs as we can.

Of course, all this comes with the caveat that this situation is changing rapidly. Your safety is of the utmost importance, and we'd like to remind you not to take medical advice from the internet. Rely on trusted sources like the WHO and CDC, check in with your local health department regularly, and please follow any advice you may receive from your own doctor.

**AskScience AMAs**

Second, we wanted to discuss our AMA series a bit. As you know, many schools have either cancelled classes or moved to online learning. This presents a unique set of challenges for students and teachers alike. Many of our expert panelists also teach, and they are working extremely hard to move their courses online very quickly.

We are putting out a call for increased AMAs, with the goal of giving as many students as possible the opportunity to interact directly with people who work in STEM fields. This goes for all disciplines, not just those related to COVID-19. We typically host scientists, but we have also had outstanding AMAs from science authors and journalists. 

As always, we plan only schedule one AMA per day, but we will be making an effort to host them more frequently. To aid in this process, we've [created a website for interested parties to use to contact us]( https://sites.google.com/view/askscienceamas/). 

We schedule AMAs well in advance, so don't hesitate to contact us now to set something up down the line. If you'd like to do an AMA with your research team, that's great, too (group AMAs are *awesome*).
If you're a student or science educator, please keep an eye on the calendar in the sidebar! As always, feel free to reach out to us via modmail with questions or comments.

To kick things off, we'd like to cordially invite to join us for an **AMA with author Richard Preston on March 17**. He is the author of a number of narrative nonfiction books, including *The Hot Zone*, *The Demon in the Freezer*, and *Crisis in the Red Zone*.

[**Anura**](https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Anura/) is the largest extant (i.e. not extinct) order of amphibians, with over 6,300 documented species. There are a few things that set frogs apart: 

- ""Anura"" means ""without a tail"" - a reference to the loss of their tails as adults. 
- One of the most unique features is called a [urostyle](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/obl4he/vertebratediversity/frogs_and_toads.html), and it's formed by fused sacral vertebrae. 
- They lack ribs, and have relatively few presacral vertebrae (fewer than 9, usually 8). 
- They also fuse some limb bones together: the radius and ulna in the arm fuse into the radio-ulna, and the tibia and fibula fuse into the tibiofibula.

We can't talk about frogs without mentioning that amphibians are experiencing a global decline, and are going extinct [much more quickly than background extinction rates](https://www.herpconbio.org/~herpconb/McCallum/amphibian%20extinctions.pdf) (PDF). There are a number of causes at play. 

One is known as [**amphibian chytrid fungus**](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/bd-frogs-apocalypse-disease/585862/). This fungus has caused the extinction of more species than any other pathogen. It has caused the decline of 501 amphibian species, caused a further 124 to drop by 90% or more, and caused the extinction of 90.

[Additional factors in amphibian decline](https://journals.openedition.org/sapiens/1406) include habitat change (destruction or loss), affecting as many as 63% of amphibian species; invasive species including fish or even other amphibian species; environmental toxins like pesticides; and global climate change.

Is it the hypovolemic shock? Is it perhaps dyselectrolytemia?   


I have a vague memory in my mind that it's because of hyponatremia, but that doesn't make much sense.

Hypernatremia makes more sense. If we don't drink water, we lose water content while our sodium stays relatively the same (we lose some through sweat, but sweat is quite low in sodium and we would lose more water than sodium anyways).

ChrisGnam,1577156448,eev45l,"So my understanding is that, according to the standard model, the fundamental particles are all point particles that occupy no space (or atleast, it is meaningless to talk about them having a size).

But if I wanted to identify a ""physical object"" (I know that gets a bit fuzzy at these scales) that occupies some physical space, it must be some form of hadron, no?  From looking online, it appears protons have a diameter of roughly 1e-15m, but is there anything smaller than that?  I thought at first mesons might be, as they are composed  of only two fundamental particles, but Wikipedia says that they are actually larger than protons.  That leads me to believe that maybe more quarks lead to smaller objects, but that now gets in a territory that I know absolutely nothing about.

ChrisGnam,1562676160,cb0de6,"My understanding is that neutrons help glue the protons together via the residual strong force, while also helping to spread the protons out to reduce coulomb repulsion by physically separating them.  This makes a bit of sense, but from this interpretation then, it would seem to me that its not just the number of protons/neutrons in the nucleus that matter, but also (to an extent) the physical placement of the neutrons and protons with respect to one another.  It would seem that an atom with ALL of its protons clumped together in a ball that is wrapped in a shell of neutrons wouldn't be stable, despite having the correct number of protons/neutrons.  I know this is a rather extreme example, but the reason for giving it is that it makes me believe that just having the right number of protons and neutrons isn't enough.  And it also raises a bunch of other questions for me such as:  

\- How many stable configurations are there for a given atom?

\- Are protons/neutrons organized ""rigidly"" into a nearly spherical nucleus?  Or can the shape of the nucleus change/deform (either with time, or maybe just being statically asymmetrical)?

\- If the distribution of protons/neutrons is even slightly asymmetrical, wouldn't this give the nucleus some kind of dipole moment?

\- Is the arrangement of the protons/neutrons always the same/similar for a given isotope?

\- For extremely heavy elements that are already unstable to begin with, does variations in the distribution of protons/neutrons help to increase or decrease stability from atom to atom?

\- Do protons and neutrons move around while in the nucleus, or are they more or less fixed in place?

Was this because the universe was thought to be expanding at a constant rate, as opposed to the now suspected Accelerating rate; a solution to which his equations could provide (sans Lambda) ?

In Hubble's original model he determined that further galaxies were moving away faster (and therefore accelerating) - is this value is the Hubble Constant?

I think it may have been that I either didn't explain myself well enough or give a good example. I think I came across a good example that would explain what I'm getting at quickly and concisely.

In the movie *Interstellar* there was a planet they named ""Miller's Planet"" which was a water world that was in a stable orbit very close to the supermassive black hole they named *Gargantua*. When they went down to that planet and then returned to their main ship, while only a few hours had passed for them, something like 23 years (I may be wrong about how many years) had passed at their main ship. This was because of the warp in space-time caused by Gargantua. 

Now, supposing that Miller's Planet had been in orbit around Gargantua for quite a while, say something like how long Earth has been around, 4.5 billion years, would the age of the universe be the same to a civilization that arose on a planet like Miller's as it is to us here on Earth? Which brings about the more fundamental question: is the universe the same age everywhere, if you were able to somehow take a consensus of numerous places in the universe simultaneously? Could other factors, such as space being created *within* the universe, compress or stretch time so as to make notable differences in whole regions of the universe?

What strikes me is that this method is particularly useful for integrating polynomial functions, with the simple rules for integrating x^n and so on, but integrating non elementary functions or any function ""further away"" from being composed of the simple addition of x^n 's, become difficult.  I'm aware of various tools for doing difficult integrals (e.g. using the residue theorem), but what I'm curious about here are integration techniques in which shapes other than polygons are used as a basis for deriving those analytic integration techniques. For example I could imagine using conic sections or hermite polynomials or the gamma function or something equally strange to build up an integration technique with respect to non elementary functions, where integrating (using such a technique) x^n might be extraordinarily difficult, but integrating some non elementary function may be trivial. Are there are a toolset of such techniques?

lasqi,1527570998,8mwjt0,"Little bit of background info: Currently I study UK A-Level Chemistry and physics, so please don't expect too much.

Recently, when studying energetics (enthalpy changes, bonding, etc.) I noticed what appeared to be contradicting statements.

For chemical bonding, in terms of energetics, we are taught exclusively that bond breaking is endothermic, and bond forming is exothermic (in all cases).

This however contradicts other information that I have read in terms of bonding within carbon; that is that when carbon forms four covalent bonds, the electrons in the 2s sub-shell move to the (higher energy) 2p sub-shell making a hybrid orbital with four electrons.

If electrons move to a higher energy level to allow bonds to form, such an interaction would require energy to be taken in by electrons to be in an excited state, and therefore be endothermic. 

It is taught in our syllabus however, that bond forming is exothermic.

I have no doubt that my syllabus is correct, but could someone offer an explanation as to why this is the case?

I asked both of my chemistry teachers, yet couldn't get an explanation, and searching the web fails to find specific enough results.

The current thinking seems to be that you cannot send information across time because in the scrambling ""eraser"" section of the experiment, we send photons through a beam splitter which results in 50% landing in detectors C and the other 50% in detector D. Due to the fact their interference patterns subsequently are perfectly out of phase, you cannot decipher waveforms with the screen alone because without being able to reference the information in the detectors, the screen alone just looks like a bunch of unorganized dots with no apparent interference pattern.

However, is there a beam splitter available to science which could send most of the photons to one of the two detectors (for example, 99% go to detector C once they are in the eraser portion of the experiment).

It would seem to me that if there's a beam splitter than can send most of the photons just to detector C (99% instead of 50%), you would pretty clearly be able to see either a waveform or not, despite a little bit of fuzziness.

This idea also seems like it would not violate nature's rules about not having certainty about path information to get the waveform interference pattern.

Suppose you have two solenoids, A and B, separated by some distance.  
A is connected, generating a static magnetic field. B is not, and is a broken circuit (i.e. cannot sustain current at all).  

I connect B, so that it is pushed outwards by A's field, and then immediately disconnect A so that it has no dipole moment. Because the field from B takes time to propagate, coil A will have zero dipole moment by the time the field ""arrives"", and so no reaction force will be generated. One object has been pushed, while the other has not, seemingly generating thrust from nowhere.

Time-varying fields aren't my strongest point, so I strongly suspect that what I'm missing is somehwere in the turning of the coils ""on"" and ""off"", i.e. that the changing fields in this window generates a non-zero Poynting vector, but this doesn't seem to grok with the symmetry of the problem.",askscience,How do Electromagnets Work with Conservation of Momentum?

I've learned a lot of metallurgical science, especially as a result of learning about heat treating, the mollecular stuff that causes copper to become softer when annealed, or steel to become harder when heated to the critical point and then rapidly cooled by quenching. One thing that I don't know, but I am curious, is why is it that alloying metals creates harder material regardless of the individual components of the alloy — that might not make sense in the way that I've expressed it so here's an example of what I mean, Bronze is an alloy of approximately 85-88% copper and 12-15% tin, and it is significantly harder than copper, however tin is very soft, soft enough that a tin ingot can be deformed by squeezing it with bare hands, similarly brass is 84-86% copper and 14-16-% with 0.5-1% lead in older pieces, it is also harder than copper (but softer than bronze) even though zinc and lead are very soft and much softer than copper — why is it that adding a softer metal to copper makes it harder as opposed to soft? To me that doesn't make any sort of logical sense, since in simple terms if I were to take a cup of water that was 30% sugar (softness) and add another half-cup of water that was 65% sugar, it would have a higher sugar content than it's individual parts and thus be more sweet than the cup that we started with, not less.",askscience,"Why is it that alloying one metal (copper) with another metal that is softer (tin) creates a product (bronze) that is harder than copper, not softer?

Now, as we know, the total entropy of the universe is supposed to increase over time. Therefore the universe should have more and more entropy as time passes on.
Plus the fact that the law of conservation of energy should hold for isolated systems.

Finally, Here's my question:
Can we consider the entire universe as an isolated system? (I mean, what else is there to affect it?) And if so, what keeps this increasing entropy of the universe from breaking the law of conservation of energy?

vwcanter,1522345059,88392p,"I am trying to explain covalent bonds to my kids, and realizing I never really understood them at all. Perhaps someone can help me understand these a little better.

In the simplest example, a sigma bond between two hydrogen atoms, there is a sigma bond orbital in which the electron density is right between the two nuclei, or alternatively, a node in the middle, and a density right at each nuclei. So presumably, in either of these, the total energy is less than in it would be when the same two electrons are in two separate s orbitals on two separate atoms. (Otherwise the sigma bond would never form.)

Now in the case of helium, such a bond never forms, but it is not clear to me that I understand the reason. It would still be the case that such a bond would leave those two electrons at a lower total energy than they would be at if they were in two separate s orbitals. I am guessing the reason is that the remaining two electrons in the s orbitals would have to be brought so close together, in the process of forming the sigma bond, that they would be at a higher energy, and that would outweigh the lower energy of the electrons in the sigma bond orbital. Is this correct?

If so, then I have to ask about the other sigma bond, the ""anti-bonding"" orbital, which appears to be a sigma bond orbital in which there is a single node right in between the nuclei (some sources appear to say that this is the typical sigma bond orbital of H2). In that case, the density is greatest right around the two nuclei, even though it is a bonded orbital. So it would seem at first glance that this bond could exist at the same time as the first sigma bond orbital, and that in the case of helium, all four electrons would be at a lower energy than they would in the separate s orbitals. However, it appears that two simultaneous sigma bonds of this type never form. So I have to ask what prevents it.

Last, I have to ask why beryllium does not have the same type of inertness as helium, because it is also characterized by a full s orbital in the ground state, and yet, it appears to form sigma bonds of exactly that type, that is, a sigma bond orbital and sigma antibonding orbital. Am I correct about this? If so, why does the same thing not happen to helium or neon?

I am guessing that the bonds formed in these compounds of beryllium involve different sigma bonds types that _can_ form simultaneously. Is this correct? I am also guessing that beryllium itself is brittle and not very useful because of this full s orbital, even though it does not make it totally inert. Am I correct about this, also?

This is what the function would look like:

https://i.imgur.com/7vLhjy2.png

The concept being that as a new particle position is calculated, instead of calculating the strength of each 3 forces seperately, just do it all in one shot. When the function returns a positive value from the green region, they are attracting based on the effect of gravity - green region. When there is enough force to push them past the negative function return - red region - they will be bound together.

The coulomb barrier would represent the magnitude of the red region, binding force in the blue region, etc... The specifics of the function in terms of distance ranges and magnitudes can be put in for accuracy.

1) Just because we can **currently** observe the universe accellerating does in no way, shape or form mean it will do so forever?     

  
As a metaphor. If I throw a ball really hard, then it will accellerate at an increasing rate before slowing down, stopping, or bouncing back. I don't understand how we being able to observe the universe expanding now, no matter how rapidly, is evidence that it will never slow down, halt, or rebound.

2) Wouldn't our very existence be proof of the big freeze being wrong? By that I mean: If the universe could end / was finite. Then the odds of us existing would be non-existent?   
  
  
Scenario A) The universe is finite  
Scenario B) The universe is infinite  
  
Scenario B is likely, because we exist.

However, this is a vague definition.

In fact, one could represent ""2-dimensional"" space with only a singular coordinate.  

For example, consider the 2-D polar coordinates (r, θ) in *R^2*; θ is in radians.  We can then create a single number C such that the even digits of C are the digits of r, and the odd digits of C are the digits of θ.  There is a 1-to-1 mapping between (r, θ) and C.

tehbagend,1521456497,85ijwj,"Here is the text from the book(slightly abridged).

""We now have time and distance intervals in the same currency. For example, they could both be given in meters, or miles or light-years or whatever. Figure  illustrates two events in spacetime, denoted by little crosses. The bottom line is that we want a rule for figuring out how far apart the two events are in spacetime. Looking at the figure, we want to know the length of the hypotenuse given the lengths of the other two sides. To be a little more precise, we shall label the length of the base of the triangle as x while the height is ct. It means that the two events are a distance x apart in space and a distance ct apart in time. Our goal, then, is to answer the question “what is the hypotenuse, s, in terms of x and ct?” Making contact with our ear- lier example x = 10 meters is the distance in space from bed to kitchen table, and t = 1 hour is the distance in time. So far, since c was arbitrary, ct can be anything and we appear to be treading water. We shall press onward nonetheless. 
We have to decide on a means of measuring the length of the hypotenuse, the distance between two events in spacetime. Should we choose Euclidean space, in which case we can use Pythagoras’ theorem, or something more complicated? Perhaps our space should be curved like the surface of the earth, or maybe some other more complicated shape. There are in fact an infinite number of ways that we might imagine calculating distances..........In our case, the simplest way to construct a distance is to assume that at least the space part of our spacetime should be Euclidean; in other words, space is flat. This means that the familiar way of working out the distance in space be- tween objects in the room in which we are seated reading this book is carried over into our new framework intact. What could be simpler? The question, then, is how we should add time. Another simplifying assumption is that our spacetime is unchanging and the same everywhere........these two simplifying assumptions, we are left with only two possible choices as to how to calculate distances in spacetime. The length of the hypotenuse must be either s2 = (ct)2 + x2 or s2 = (ct)2 - x2. There is no other option. Although we did not prove it, our assumption that spacetime should be unchanging and the same everywhere leads to only these two possibilities and we must pick either the plus sign or the minus sign.""",askscience,From the book E=mc2 and why should we care (Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw).

His most famous achievement is arguably the development of the [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) in 1915. General relativity is an extremely well-tested theory of gravity, with implications for mechanics, astrophyiscs, cosmology, and more. It has been a hot topic lately with the direct detection of [gravitational waves](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-are-gw).

Besides his work in gravity, Einstein was known for a great many other things. In 1921 he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the [photoelectric effect](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/einstein-s-legacy-the-photoelectric-effect/). He also worked on thermodynamic/statistical physics (such as [Brownian motion](http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/152.mf1i.spring02/BrownianMotion.htm) and [Bose-Einstein statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_statistics)), the famous [mass-energy equivalence](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equivME/), [atomic physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_coefficients), [quantum mechaincs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Brillouin%E2%80%93Keller_method), and more.

&gt;On the other hand, exposition of women to phytoestrogens (isoflavones, lignans, coumestans of different botanical sources) in pre- and postmenopausal period may prevent the menopausal symptoms induced by declined endogenous estrogen production – hot flashes, vasomotor symptoms, vaginal atrophy a.o., whilst no negative side-effect of these phytoestrogens on breast and endometrial health have been observed (Kronenberg and Fugh-Berman, 2002; Branca and Lorenzetti, 2005; Bedell et al., 2012).

[...]

&gt;Meta-analyses indicated no statistically significant association between soy isoflavones consummation and men plasma estrogen and androgen level (van Die et al., 2013). 

And as noted earlier in the review:
&gt;Phytoestrogens are strikingly similar in chemical structure to the mammalian estrogen, estradiol, and bind to estrogen receptors alpha and beta with a preference for the more recently described estrogen receptor beta (Younes and Honma, 2011; Rietjens et al., 2013; Paterni et al., 2014).

[...]

&gt;Phytoestrogens besides their ability to bind to estrogen receptors, have other biological effects, which are not mediated with these receptors

I am hoping someone better acquainted with the literature and reproductive science could help connect all these dots for me. It sounds like phytoestrogens can exert some effects similar to that of estrogens, but in some cases don't exert those effects at all, or exert other unrelated effects.

Some males express concern over the consumption of phytoestrogen-containing foods, e.g. soy, due to perceived risk of 'feminization' through increased 'estrogen' intake.

However, in certain computer circuits, such as latches, data can be stored permanently by looping an output wire back into the input of the circuit. For instance, in an AND-OR Latch, you could store a value of 'one' by inputting S as 'one' and R as 'zero' and then changing S to 'zero' as well. But how is this 'one' value (implying current) retained in the circuit indefinitely when both of its inputs have been set to 'zero' (no current input)? Wouldn't the electrons flowing in the wire eventually lose their kinetic energy to the wire's resistance and destroy the value stored in the circuit?

The electrons are attracted to the positive terminal and will flow from the minues terminal to the capacitor plate. This negative charge of the plate will push electrons away from the other plate, making the second plate positively charged.

What happened to the electrons in the positive plate? I assume those electrons get pushed back into the positive terminal.

Doesn't this now mean the voltage between the battery terminals is less now? Because the positive terminal gained electrons. So then the attraction force pulling electrons is lower than original, right? So the voltage of the battery has dropped. Shouldn't this mean the voltage of when the capacitor and battery are equal is a lower voltage than the battery? Because if we say the capacitor will charge to the original battery voltage, doesn't this imply that even though the positive terminal gained electrons, the battery voltage has remained the same? Kind of weird to think about, if you imagine a +2 charge and two electrons separated. Say one electron goes to the +2 particle, so what's left is +1 particle and 1 electron. Now the force and hence voltage between the electron and positive particle is less because the other electron neutralized one positive charge.


So what I'm saying is:

Yes, I agree the battery and capacitor voltages will eventually be equal.

But the voltage at which this happens is lower than the original battery voltage.

My main questions: 

Is a photon just that? A ripple in the electromagnetic field? 

Do different energy photons have different amplitudes as well as frequencies? 

When explaining light waves are we talking about the same 'ripple' in the EM filed as I take a photon to be? 


My confusion stemmed mainly from when I saw a gif showing a sine wave made up of little balls (photons) that was supposed to be demonstrating what light 'is'

I'm not very confident in my conception of light. Anyone able to clear some stuff up would be much appreciated!! THANKS

If we could create any conceivable animal we wanted, could we create a line of intermediate breeders between any two species? In some definitions, would that make those two now the same ""species""?

Thanks.

EDIT: Seems like all the questions have been answered. These type of relationships are known as ""ring species"". Credit to u/legoman_86 List of examples on [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species). 

It can be a large number of connections. But, I believe it's not necessary that there be a certain amount of hypothetical animals that could connect any two species. If there are different chromosomes, for example, it seems like that would serve as an insurmountable difference that could not be connected by taking baby steps between two species.

EDIT 2: Just realized the language I used is directly referenced on the Wikipedia page: ""Formally, the issue is that interfertility (ability to interbreed) is not a transitive relation – if A can breed with B, and B can breed with C, it does not follow that A can breed with C – and thus does not define an equivalence relation.""",askscience,"Are there groups of animals where ""A and B can have fertile offspring"", ""B and C can can have fertile offspring"", but ""A and C cannot""?"

This means that  the electrons spin could change to be oriented in any direction after it leaves the nucleus. 

Now, please correct me if I am wrong, but if I am right that changing the spin takes energy based on how much it has been rotated, there is a violation of energy conservation somewhere here, as the photon would contribute a quantized amount of energy that wouldn't be able to account for the future measurement at an arbitrary angle with respect to its original orientation.

I tried doing the same calculation for angular momentum. For angular momentum it is fairly simple to show that the operator Lz = -i h-bar d/dtheta, and thus the eigenvalues must be n h-bar (where n is an integer, this is assuming the wavefunction is single-valued).

The part that confuses me is that this derivation has integer multiples of a unit of angular momentum, but I haven't put any information about the particle itself into the formula.

VaperDude89,1518371536,7wu99b,"I just read this really interesting article. 

https://principia-scientific.org/modern-solar-grand-maximum-ends-little-ice-age-cooling-coming/

It claims that we've been in a period of extremely uncommon solar activity, from around 1920, until present day.  It also claims that these Solar Periods cause pretty big changes to global temperatures, and climates(seemingly much bigger than the ones we've experienced recently). 

I always see on Reddit that people claim that Global Warming is caused by Human actions.  I tend to believe this(but, it has hardly been proven, due to the near impossibility of proving such a thing, with any certainty).  

It seems that we have a case, where in 1920, the sun started a ""Grand Solar Maximum Phase"", that has caused it to release more energy, and thus warm earth at a greater rate than it has in thousands of years(it's a very abnormally ""high"" Grand Solar Maximum).

And, also, around 1920, Humans started releasing massive amounts of Fossil Fuel Waste Gasses into the atmosphere.

To me, as a layman, it would seem to be very hard to differentiate, or determine exactly how much warming is coming from the Sun's uncharacteristic(most solar rays released in thousands of years)  behavior... and how much is cased by the ""Green House Effect"", from Humans releasing CO2, and methane.  

So, I'm just wondering with what level of certainty, we know that Humans are causing the MAJORITY of global warming(Greater than 50%).  From what I've read, it seems that it's mainly a guess in the scientific community, how much the warming is because casued by the Sun heating the earth more than it has in thousands of years... and how much is caused by human activity.

One thing seems to be for certain... the Sun's Grand Maximum Cycle is causing Global Warming.  Nobody disagrees with that.  

I'm just wondering how much actual scientific certainty there is, that this is being caused to a large degree by human activity, as well.  On Reddit, I see people who think it's nearly 100% caused by human activity, and that science knows this with near 100% certainty.  Is this true?

This is what i understand for the most part: an object glows when it gets hot because the neutrons colliding give off electromagnetic radiation. As the temperature rises the color of the glow changes from red to yellow to blue.

Why do moving and coliding particles give off electromagnetic waves such as visible light or infrared?

Why do colder objects give off longer waves and hoter objects give off shorter waves?

Does an object have to be black to be a blackbody?

Do all objects give off blackbody radiation?

If stars can be so hot to be red, yellow, or blue does this mean they are or near black in color? If so what makes a star black? Can a star be invisible to our eyes by emiting only ifrared or UV light?

Basically i understand what is happening to a blackbody object, i just dont get why it happens or what makes it happen to one object and not another.



Another thing from this chapter that is less relsted to astronomy:

Atoms can obsorb photons if the wavelength of the photon has the right amount of energy. Waves without the correct energy just get bounced off, right? Is the bouced off wave the color we see with our eyes?

in the book it says an atom that obsorbs a photon of the corect wavelength becomes unstable(due to neutron changing levels) and re-radiates the photon in a random direction.

Since the limit of how fast anything can move is the speed of light, does that mean that there is an actual finite number of energy that any mass can reach? If something were to move at the speed of light, the energy of the system can be calculated easily using formulas we know, but it only translate into energy from movement if I remember correctly. For example, if a mass were to travel at the speed of light, let's say it has 1000 joules.  Can the system have more than 1000 joules? Seeing as how a system can have energy beyond kinetic, it should be able to have more than 1000 joules, because that only quantifies the kinetic portion of the system. However, is this true? If the system holds more energy, would that not translate into movement? From my understanding, almost all energy has to do with movement. For example, temperature could be explained as the movement/vibrations of matter. The hotter it is the more motion the particles have, which is why objects at absolute zero don't have any motion (0 energy).

AnitaSnarkeysian,1517938748,7vp0sd,"[Measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere have historically (or at least in the last couple hundred thousand years) reached a peak of about 300 ppm. Today, however, they have reached roughly 400 ppm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere).

100 ppm is a difference of 0.01%... which is to say that our atmosphere should be 0.03% CO2, but instead we (humans) have caused it to be 0.04%.

I began to wonder, how does such a (relatively) small percentage change lead us to such devastating consequences? How much better at trapping heat is CO2 compared to N2, O2, or Ar?

In my pursuit of this answer, I tried to give myself the best crash course I could on greenhouse effects. It sounds like Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Argon (collectively they make up &gt;99.9% of the Earths atmosphere) are not good at trapping heat. So my hypothesis, is that, although the percentage of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere are proportionally very small, they are so much better at trapping heat, that despite their small proportion, they are doing almost all of the work when it comes to trapping heat. Looking at it from this perspective, it would make sense that a 33% increase in a greenhouse gas would have a large effect. Am I on the right track?

I thought that I could prove my hypothesis by finding a table with some sort of measurement of a gasses ability to retain (trap) heat. For example, I hoped that I could find some data demonstrating that CO2 trapped heat x% better than either N2 or O2. I was able to find some tables like this between the major greenhouse gases, but I did not find data that included N2, O2, or AR, so I did not feel like I was able to sufficiently satisfy my curiosity. As I looked into why N2, O2 and Ar were not included, the typical answer seemed to be that those gasses trap almost no heat, but that bothered me because even if the amount of heat that they trap is near negligibly small, I think knowing the multiplier between the non-greenhouse gasses and the greenhouse gasses would be good information.

TallisTate,1517808512,7vcmzr,"I just saw this in an AskReddit thread where someone said that the morning after pill works to prevent ovulation and fertilization. This caught me a little off guard, so I wanted to ask about this here! I'm not in the US - I'm in South America. Although I eventually dropped out, I did go to med school for three years, and I distinctly remember my pharmacology professor and later an OBGYN preceptor during my first clinical clerkship saying that levonorgestrel has a higher chance of taking a post-fertilization MOA. I believe there was some study that pointed to that as well - scientists from Spain, I think? I'm trying to find something in English rather than Portuguese and the first thing I came across was this: 
 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5102184/

For reference, emergency contraception is available without a prescription here in Brazil. Someone in class asked if it induces a miscarriage/acts as an abortive medication, and the professor started going in detail about how *technically*, there is a chance that the drug works to prevent a pregnancy that's already started (very early stage, though...).

IIRC, the explanation given is that this particular EC ""tricks"" the body - it rapidly increases the progestogen levels that the body normally builds up after ovulation. This causes the endometrium lining of the uterus to thicken and then as the progestogen levels start to decline, the person who took the EC gets their period. They did say that the pre or post fertilization MOA depends on what stage of the menstrual cycle the woman taking it is in.

It's funny that most of the web searches in Portuguese do mention the post-fertilization MOA. Now, when I searched for this in English, most information available (not in official research, more like Your Reproductive System 101) emphasized that this drug *prevents ovulation* and that it absolutely did not work the same as abortion pills.

So...that got me curious, and I wanted to know what's the cause of this divergence in information. Thanks! ",askscience,How does emergency contraception (morning after pill) containing levonorgestrel work? Pre-fertilization or post-fertilization MOA?

Here's *my* explanation of the gold foil experiment (so you can correct me if I'm missing/wrong about anything significant): Rutherford took a piece of gold foil and placed it inside an alpha-particle detecting ring. He then shot alpha particles at the gold foil. Because the vast majority of particles went straight through the foil and were not deflected, he concluded that atoms are mostly empty space.

Here's where I'm confused: we now know for certain that he was right. But at the time, why was it not equally reasonable to conclude that there was a lot of space *between* the atoms?

The book was written in 1997, my question is, what forms of progress have we made since then, and is there anything we can definitely rule out?

For those who haven't read it, he proposes different possible solutions or formats for solutions for the branches between quantum and classical physics. He also raises questions about biophysical processes and consciousness, that maybe there is an answer to be found in quantum level biophysical processes that could explain consciousness in a scientific sense.

If all that seems too hard to answer without actually reading the book, there are three general theses he poses,

1.  Mentality can be treated scientifically 
2. The ideas of quantum mechanics are relative to the mind body problem
3. The quantum mechanical problem of the actualization of potentialities is a genuine physical problem that cannot be solved without modifying the quantum formalism

I also read that this method preserves epigenetic information, like DNA methylation which inactivates certain genes. So far, so good.

Then I stumbled upon  [this Nature Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060), which tells us that post-reading protocols can effectively reduce the error rate, leaving us with an effective accuracy of 99.88%.

I live in Germany, where nuclear power is commonly not considered clean energy. This is mostly due to the extremly longliving toxic waste it produces. Therefor we have big political movements in Germany pushing for shutting down the nuclear power production all together. Thus (as far as I know) there hasn't been that much modernization going on over the past few decades.

A few years ago I read somewhere that nuclear power production today is far below it's potential and that modern scientific research is quite promising regarding the effiency (I think it said that were at ~10% of the potential effiency due to our lack of modernization) and waste production (I remember something about ways to reduce the radioactive waste to minimum of what is currently done). I also remember reading something about ways to recycle spent fuel to bascially use it up until it's gone and power plants that are basically failsafe.

Sadly I have no idea where I read this and I don't remember it looking very 'scientific' (iirc it was one of these pseudo-scientific looking inforgraphics).

So I was wondering if you could tell me what acutally would be possible if mankind was to decide to heavily invest in modernizing nuclear power production and what could be expected from further research. Are there known ways to get rid of dangerous radioactive waste? Or is this just the propaganda of the nuclear lobby, trying to convince people that renewable energy sources are not the absolutly best option for the future?",askscience,What's the current state of research for nuclear power regarding efficiency and nuclear waste production?

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.

First of all, I'm gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: As an example, ""Tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""Tawat 'ankhu qaman"" ([taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn]).

* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u/Ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point. 

Thanks so much for all the great answers, everyone. It totally answered my question and questions I didn't know I had.

So the assumption made before conducting the diagonalization is that the set of all whole numbers is countable/listable. To me that already sounds like a contradiction but I digress.

So we make the set of all whole numbers correspond to the same infinite amount of random rational numbers. 
It's hard to get past that contradiction in the first part, but let's say we do that and we produce a completely new rational number that has no matching pair on the whole number side.
 
It seems to me like the only reason we ""run out"" of whole numbers is because Cantor or whoever defined the set to be ""countable/listable"" which in my book is the same as saying ""finite"", but I'm sure there is a definition there that I do not know.

My logic says that both are picking numbers from infinite baskets, neither of which will run out of numbers.

Perhaps there is a real world application that would enlighten me but I stand firm to believe that this argument isn't valid at all.

Edit: 

To reinforce my argument let's consider the statement ""the set of all even numbers is the same size as even **and** **odd** numbers"". Could we not extrapolate that statement into the realm between whole numbers?

AJRivers,1516837881,7srn25,"We always treat gravity (From the Earth) as a force pulling us straight down, but isn’t that just an average of the contributing vectors?

For example, If I were standing at the North Pole, the large masses of earth underneath Africa, north America, and Australia are all exerting a force on my body, but all at different angles—It’s only the accumulated force of all the particles of the earth pulling at me that average out to be straight down right? Since gravity is a vector, don’t different particles at different points on the Earth, “Cancel out” some of the effects of the others?

So my question is—when calculating the pull of gravity precisely, wouldn’t one need the variables of mass, distance *and* the shape and volume of the object to get accurate results? I guess if you’re doing math for gravity, the object will probably be spherical, but wouldn’t a single point with the same mass as the Earth at x distance from an object have a more *direct* pull of gravity than the Earth itself at x distance and thus a greater magnitude? If the Earth instantly compressed down to a single point at the center of it’s core, would it accelerate me more than 9.8 m/s^2 towards it?

(I realize all the mass between me and the core would be that much further away, and thus have less influence, but all the mass on the far side of the earth would be that much closer as well, I’m just wondering how much focusing gravity would increase it).

nschoe,1516807377,7sns41,"Hi all,

I've begun playing around with Kerbal Space Program and there are some things that are unclear to me when it comes to orbital mechanics.

In orbital mechanics, speed and altitude are linked: a satellite or a ship orbits a body at a given altitude and a given speed (at least that's what I understand). If I increase the speed (by burning prograde) I will ~~increase~~ decrease my altitude and _vice versa_.

I also understand that if I burn normal (or antinormal) I increase (decrease) the angle of my orbit: this seems easy to understand when summing speed vectors.

What I don't get is burning radial out / in. Suppose I'm orbiting the body at 2000m/s @ 100km. If I burn radial out (away from the body), I will increase my altitude (because I'm providing thrust in that direction).
Then if I stop burning, let's say I'm now at 110km altitude, what happens? Well I'm at 110km altitude for which the orbital speed is supposed to be 2100m/s (for instance, haven't made the calculations), but I'm still going 2000m/s because I haven't accelerated in the direction I'm orbiting. So the ship / satellite should begin to lose altitude to get back to 100km, right?

Or am I missing something?

Another question that is related: how is it even possible to do orbital rendez-vous?

I mean if I'm trying to rendez-vous with a satellite orbiting the body at a certain speed (and thus altitude). If I come from ""under"", meaning if I have a lower altitude, then I have a higher speed. So I'm ""gaining"" on it. Suppose I time my prograde burn so that I rise to the target altitude (and speed) but I'm a few kilometers ahead of the target. Then I'm toasted right? Because if I'm a few kilometers ahead of the satellite and try to slow down a bit by burning retrograde so that it can catch up on me, then I'm also lowering my orbit.

I get that we have computer models that make very powerful computations, but when we are talking about docking a ship to the ISS, I suppose the computer models cannot compute a single burn that will place the ship at _exactly_ the correct position and speed, at mm/s and mm accuracy. So there has to be adjustment burns, even minor ones. But since altitude and speeds are always linked, how does one position exactly at the correct speed and altitude?

Sorry if this is obvious, but something's not ticking with me on this one :/

One of the question is the following : there is two parallel pipes, crossing only at particular places (where collision detectors are, obviously).
According to drawings and explanations i found, these two pipes are arranged so they are side by side (they have the same altitude).

This seems odd to me because (1) this makes the outer pipe longer than the inner pipe, since they both follow the same line and (2) needs more complex arrangement of the magnets that curves the particles trajectory.
This probably have a consequence on computations and engineering implementation.

With a sudden change in building code many were quick to try to be compliant but it happened that few people understood the air flow rates and science. Worse specifications were rarely enforced at the time of implementation. Ultimately the fan motors proved to be a fired hazard that has claimed countless houses across the US.

Then to bring it full circle, the story teller eventually mentions lead paint was banned because someone drew a correlation with lead exposure inhibiting child development and low inner city test scores. The reasoning was ""test scores must be low because kids are eating paint chips.""

ICanBeHandyToo,1516483035,7rt6u9,"More specifically, I've come across an example for a hypothetical physics experiment that highlights an aspect of quantum superposition (the book makes short reference to the Furry hypothesis but doesn't really go into detail with it).

In the experiment, a source sends out a pair of entangled photons to two detectors that measure the incoming light. Both detectors are equidistant from the source such that they should receive their individual photon simultaneously. Each detector is equipped with a controllable polarized beam splitter (with three potential positions: +30, 0, -30 degrees) that separates the incoming light into vertically and horizontally polarized light. When both detectors have the same polarization in their beam splitters, the results measured by the detectors are correlated.

The text first suggests the following (incorrect) hypothesis: if both polarizers have the same orientation, the detectors return the same result. If the polarizers have different orientations, the detectors don't get the same result. Is this the Furry hypothesis or just a common thought experiment to introduce superposition?",askscience,"What is the Furry hypothesis, in relation to quantum superposition, and why is it incorrect?"

My question is: What exactly is this curvature?

I've seen numerous [models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg) portray the curvature as 3rd dimensional curvature in a 2D plane, or, in other words, a [gravity well](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/gravity_wells_large.png), and, having begun to contemplate higher dimensions on an alarmingly frequent basis, I simply extrapolated to gravity being (n+1)th dimensional curvature of n dimensional space, which, on our 3D space, combined with time, gives us 5 total dimensions (which I believe is hinted at in interstellar, as the Gargantua scene features a 5D tessaract).

However, I have heard that this is not the case, that instead, gravity is n dimensional stretching of n dimensional space, lacking any intrusion into dimension (n+1).

As the latter option seems less curvy than the first, and as it is far less intuitive than mere higher dimensional curvature (and, IMO, fails to account for black holes and wormholes), I prefer to think of gravity as higher dimensional curvature. However, I am uncertain if this is actually how the universe works, and I'd like some answers.

conchushellob,1516253741,7r7k49,"I’m aware that the brain’s motion is dampened by the cerebrospinal fluid it floats in and by its tethering to the spinal cord and the meninges, but I have trouble seeing how this is sufficient to protect the brain from subtle damage just short of a concussion. 

I tend to visualize a brain-sized egg (with strange holes through the middle for ventricles) in an egg-shaped capsule filled with water (or at least some fluid with the same viscosity) bouncing around as it’s shaken. The brain as an egg isn’t the best analogy for a number of reasons, but it seems to me that motions like head banging, shaking rapidly, turning the head quickly to the side and back, etc. would crack this egg, or at least push it against the walls of its egg-skull with some nonzero force, especially considering that there is little distance between the brain/egg and the skull, and that the fluid isn’t very thick. 

My question therefore encompasses a few questions several of which likely do not have or can not have full answers:
1. Is our brain really moving a lot less than intuition might suggest? 
2. If so, how do we know? Have simulations of this been performed?
3. If not, and the brain does move within our skull as much as such analogies might suggest, does this actually cause any real damage? 

4. Adding to that last bit, what are the mechanisms of potential damage? Are neurons actually dying? Is our brain just chemically disrupted? How resistant to compression is brain tissue (does it “bounce back”)? And given shearing forces can rip axons apart, how much force does this take? Does it occur on some minimal level with all grades of TBI? Is there a particular number of g’s associated with symptomatic damage?

5. To what extent does this depend on individual anatomy, and what research has been done into this?

6. Finally, what is known about the brain’s ability to recover? Does it depend on region (impacted, not geographic)? Genetics? Environmental factors? On a less clinical note, does the brain tend to rewire itself similarly to how it was previously wired, or does it form newer connections based on environment and other factors? What research has been done on these effects in vitro/in vivo/in Volvo? Are we really us after sustaining a brain injury or a series of cumulative small hits? 

Also, as an aside, the argument that evolution has developed mechanisms that prevent significant subconcussive damage (even if we don’t fully understand them) doesn’t seem too convincing either, because evolution only requires that we survive long enough to reproduce, not so much that we perform the kinds of higher order thinking tasks we do today, let alone well into our old age when consequent neurodegenerative disorders might manifest.

4. How autonomous are individual towers? If my device is within range of 3 towers how do they decide which one will manage my device? Are there ""supervisor"" nodes managing multiple towers to make those kind of decisions? If so what kind of hardware does that have to run and how many towers can be managed at once?

For the question we are given an object that launches vertically upward at 160 m/s and undergoes only quadratic air drag with a drag coefficient of 0.0043 m-1. The drag coefficient is defined as (k/m).

Now I've done the problem (which asks for time to max height, and distance travelled to max height, as well as total time for flight) using forces [ ma = -kv^2 -mg (going up) , and ma = kv^2 - mg (going down) ] but I was wondering if it would be possible to use Lagrangian equations to solve this.

From what I understand I need a dissipating function to account for the energy lost because of the air drag, and I think I can use the Rayleigh dissipation function defined as, F = (1/2)k(dy/dt)^2 Then when I put the dissipation function into my equation I would set the negative partial derivative of F with respect to the partial derivative of y(dot) equal to the Lagrange equation?

It is the fastest thing ever built &amp; I’m struggling to wrap my head around how fast that really is.

The moon doesn’t have an atmosphere like earths so it wouldn’t burn up before striking the surface. 
Does Voyager travel fast enough to damage the moon in any significant way or would we notice any effect? Or is it simply too small to be nothing more than another negligible crater?

If it were traveling that fast towards earth (and for some reason had a heat shield/was durable enough to withstand atmospheric disintegration) would its speed cause an extinction event such as the meteor that killed the dinosaurs? I ask since Voyagers mass is much smaller than the meteor’s.

I know that objects falling towards earth have a specific terminal velocity that can’t be passed, but Voyager is traveling so much faster than that. Would the atmosphere really slow it down to a terminal velocity or would it simply rip right through?

anotheraccount5001,1514898129,7nmah7,"In my limited understanding of the human skeleto-muscular system I am aware there are 2 types of muscle fibers. 

Fast twitch: Develop from sprint-like exercise such as running sprints, 50m swimming races, lifting heavy weights close to your maximum limit etc.

Slow twice: Develop from endurance exercise such as long distance running and swimming, lifting light weights for prolonged periods/repetitions.

My question is because in the gymming and weight lifting community there is a consensus that muscle growth (size) occurs when the muscles are put under duress and they fatigue. I am told that fatigue is essential in muscle growth because it generates muscular repair and rebuilds the muscle larger than before. 

Therefore lifting heavy weights is advocated because it puts the muscles under more fatigue and subsequently more growth. Growth of which is that of fast twitch fibers.

But is there any scientific difference in the composition of fast twitch and slow twitch fibers that makes them larger?

If a weight lifter were to lift only &lt;5kg but for prolonged periods of 50-100 reps, that then fatigued the muscle, would the developing slow twitch muscle fibers be smaller than compared to fast twitch ones?

If the answer is no, why do people not commonly build muscle size through slow twitch fibers?

I get how Ampere's law works for static currents, and I can also follow the mathematical steps that are used to add the Maxwell term. (The divergence of a curl is zero, so Ampere's law always results in the rate of change of charge density being zero. Then adding an unknown vector field to the original equation and rearranging everything using Gauss's law and the equation of continuity gives the Maxwell term of εμ ∂**E**/∂t.)

But even though I can follow the maths, I can't shake the feeling that it's like using the same information twice in one equation. The μ**J** term is the current density, so it represents the movement of charge. And the εμ ∂**E**/∂t term is the change in electric field, so it represents... also the movement of charge?

Dagl1,1514411490,7mi2v3,"I've been reading a few books about quantum mechanics. In one of them the concept of quantum teleportation is explained, in layman terms: 

We want to ""teleport"" the quantum information of particle X from location A to B. We entangle particles Y and Z and send Y to A and Z to B. We subsequently entangle X and Y and measure some quantum state of X which, due to the uncertainty principle leaves us unable to know definitive information about the other quantum state(s). In this process Y's superposition is destroyed and Z is (according to the book) primed with the information we lost due to our measurement of X. The measurement information is than transferred to location B where this information is combined with the information gained from the primed Z particle, enabling us to fully and exactly teleport the quantum state of particle X.

This seems, to me, like cheating our way around the uncertainty principle and as I am 100% that this is impossible, I must have misunderstood certain aspects.

I get the basics of it, that when you add the voltage and the voltage drop it equals zero. What I don't understand is why the voltage total ~~returning to the battery~~ must always be zero. (Correcting on my misnomer) To further elaborate I don't understand why they always equal the same and cancel each other out.

If a line is too long and has too much of a voltage drop then there won't be enough voltage to create a closed circuit. That makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense is what happens if there isn't enough voltage drop and whether that is possible due to KVF.

Is this for safety to not overload the circuit? Is this an observation of physics that states by the time the current has reached the end of the circuit there's no more voltage left to push it? I just don't understand why it always equals zero, even on a closed circuit with no components. I get that even the wire itself will have some negligible resistance that creates resistance, but I don't understand why the simple wire would create a voltage drop equal to the voltage.

I've seen lots of math that explains it when there's components in the circuit and it makes sense to me, but I don't understand how it could possibly apply to a short circuit and no components.

Abstract
Aims
The debate on the funding and availability of cytotoxic drugs raises questions about the contribution of curative or adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to survival in adult cancer patients.

Materials and methods
We undertook a literature search for randomised clinical trials reporting a 5-year survival benefit attributable solely to cytotoxic chemotherapy in adult malignancies. The total number of newly diagnosed cancer patients for 22 major adult malignancies was determined from cancer registry data in Australia and from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data in the USA for 1998. For each malignancy, the absolute number to benefit was the product of (a) the total number of persons with that malignancy; (b) the proportion or subgroup(s) of that malignancy showing a benefit; and (c) the percentage increase in 5-year survival due solely to cytotoxic chemotherapy. The overall contribution was the sum total of the absolute numbers showing a 5-year survival benefit expressed as a percentage of the total number for the 22 malignancies.

Results
The overall contribution of curative and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to 5-year survival in adults was estimated to be 2.3% in Australia and 2.1% in the USA.

Conclusion
As the 5-year relative survival rate for cancer in Australia is now over 60%, it is clear that cytotoxic chemotherapy only makes a minor contribution to cancer survival. To justify the continued funding and availability of drugs used in cytotoxic chemotherapy, a rigorous evaluation of the cost-effectiveness and impact on quality of life is urgently required.

Klavierente,1513381543,7k3lia,"Hello!

I hope I'm posting this in the right sub-reddit; if that's not the case I apologise.

**First off:** I'd like to point out that this question is tied to me writing a fantasy/sci-fi book. So, accuracy of course would be great, but even ""wild"" theories are welcome! I just want to give some sort of explaination for what happens in my book instead of just far-fetching things and tell the reader ""Oh well. It's just the way it is."" Also my english is a bit rusty, so bear with me. Also I'm welcoming any other idea that revolves around a logical explaination for a radioactive infestation of the planet.

**To cut things short:** 
Could it be possible to create a implosion type or gun-type atomic bomb with an undiscovered element or any other element except Uran/Plutonium? 

**And if so:**
Is there one element that ""infests"" the environment for only 200-500 years?

I read that Neptunium is a solid canidate to build atom bombs with and just due to historical events scientists chose not to work with this element.

Book: New element found -&gt; Crafty bomb -&gt; Makes big boom -&gt; Big scale enviromental desaster -&gt; hello mutants -&gt; yeay after ~250 years no more radiation!

I very much like this subreddit because of the wide variety of questions that are asked here, from really theoretical questions to daily applications of science.

The thing I woud like to talk about belongs in the second category of daily applications of science in shooting plastic bottle caps. I am sure that a lot of you have tried this at some point, but let me explain what I mean exactly: If you take an empty plastic bottle (for example a water bottle or a soda bottle) and try to crunch it as much as you can with the cap still on it, you will be able to build up a lot of air pressure inside the bottle. If you then quickly unscrew the cap while the air is compressed, the cap will shoot off!

I do not know a lot of physics myself, but most of the fluid dynamics that I have heard of revolved around incompressible fluids and not gases, so I was wondering if there were any formulas or calculations one could make to figure out things like the **compressibility of the air** inside a plastic bottle, the built up **potential energy** in compressing the bottle and the conversion from potential to **kinetic energy** when you shoot the cap.

aganchev,1511863025,7g344q,"Hi Redditors,

This is my first post here. I've been trying to understand batteries and have found most sites I found either had explanations that were too shallow or too long and specific. I'm wondering if someone can point me to the right direction? The topics I have of interest are:

1) Battery charging
- Batteries charged only up to 80-90% as opposed to 100% increase in usable life and total charge cycle capacity? Why?
- What determines the maximum Jolts per second a battery can discharge or be charged by? What is the limit? Does it just explode if you give it too much juice?
- There seems to be two-fold decay in the charging efficiency. First as you increase the jolts per second you are charging the battery with and second as the battery nears fuller capacity you also lose charge efficiency. I.e. more electricity ""warms the air"" as charging speed and battery capacity charged increase. Specifics on these factors? Are there more?

2) Battery chargers
- There is also an inefficiency (electricity lost) in charging electronics. Is it better to charge a battery from another battery? Or is it the same as grid to battery? What is the inefficiency in charging caused from?
- What limits the charging speed? Is it the charger or the battery receiver or both?

3) Do the answers above depend on the battery type you are using or do the rules hold true for all battery types?

Then in 2000, NASA published this: [New Report Offers Evidence of Primitive Life on Mars](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/1999_2001/j00-84.html). They said the new research 'strongly support[ed] the primitive life on Mars hypothesis of David McKay and coauthors in 1996'.

From having personally worked with NASA scientists who were involved in recent Mars missions, they spoke openly about their belief that our evidence of primitive life on Mars was conclusive, and had progressed their research towards seeking the environmental factors that would allow such life to have developed.

I've been told it happens due to the absorption and re-emission of the photons and that this is similiar to what we learned in the photoelectric effect when electrons absorb photons but I've also been told it's due to the oscillating electric field interacting with the greater number of electrons in the denser material causing interference or resistance but I don't understand how this resistance occurs, if this is correct of course.

I tried to do some research and there were a lot of articles from 5 or more years ago. I thought I had a simple understanding of dark energy but I haven't seen it stated anywhere or explained recently. Is the explanation of dark energy still as elusive now as it was then?

My understanding is that in the beginning when the big bang happened, all of the forces of the universe were already present. Dark energy being a force driving matter away from other matter. Gravity being the force that pulls matter towards one another. With all of the matter in the universe being so close together after the big bang the expanding effect of dark energy was slowed due to gravity. Now fast forward to a much more spread out universe. Gravity has less of an effect because there is so much matter outside of each other's gravitational pull. This is what I thought explained the exponential expansion of the universe.

In this book I found by chance on Google, the author claims that “solutions of the wave equation only take the form of functions (...) in one and three dimensions. In two dimensions solutions are more complex”. Then, at the end of the paragraph of interest (which I posted the print here) he claims that in two dimensions, backward propagating terms are present but that is not the case for one and three dimensions.

As I have learned on multiple sources, the difference between odd and even dimensions is that on even dimensions the wave equation gives rise to infinite velocities for the propagation, creating a sharp wave front but diffuse tail. There’s a pretty great reddit post which clarifies exactly that (https://www.google.com.br/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/37xu2m/how_do_evendimensional_waves_behave/), but there’s no mention of backward propagating waves, just different velocities.

ArosHD,1510778177,7d70ap,"&gt;While electrodynamics holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant (c), the speed at which light propagates in a material may be significantly less than c. For example, the speed of the propagation of light in water is only 0.75c. Matter can be accelerated beyond this speed (although still to less than c) during nuclear reactions and in particle accelerators. Cherenkov radiation results when a charged particle, most commonly an electron, travels through a dielectric (electrically polarizable) medium with a speed greater than that at which light propagates in the same medium.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation

OK so I understand that C is a constant and that light doesn't always travel at that speed, and only does so in a vacuum.

But, I don't understand how these electrons can travel faster than the local speed of light (in that medium)?
One analogy I can think of is that a cheetah (light) is faster than a shark (electron) on land (vacuum), but in water (medium in Cherenkov radiation) the shark would be faster, but still not as fast as the cheetah is on land. This is because the shark is better suited for water.

Is this analogy accurate? So does this mean these electrons in Cherenkov radiation are for some reason better suited in this medium than light is? If so, why? Or is there another explanation? I don't understand how an electron can be better suited since photons of light seem to have everything going for them including size and mass. Can the light be made to still go faster than the electrons in this medium if someone wanted to?

From a physicist undergraduate's point of view, knowing not much about human anatomy, I can say a couple of things.

1. The brain ends up dying during cardiac arrest because no oxygen is reaching it.

2. We can't live without a brain.

3. The air in our lungs is recycled by breathing so that our blood can be oxygenated in order to provide oxygen to all organs.

4. If we didn't breath, we couldn't pull oxygen out of the air in our lungs indefinitely, else we wouldn't have to breath at all.

So, once one goes into cardiac arrest, one stops breathing. Doing CPR without mouth-to-mouth, in my opinion, would be as useless as never breathing, the blood would become less and less oxygenated over time.

mojosam,1510552044,7cl43s,"So, as a science enthusiast, I'm reading up (on Wikipedia) on the evolution of mammals, about amniotes splitting into the sauropsid and synapsid groups, and about how ""synapsids are distinguished by a single hole, known as the temporal fenestra, in the skull behind each eye"". Since mammals are synapsids, I was naturally curious about how the temporal fenestra manifests itself in modern mammals, and especially whether it's still present in some form in humans, something you'd expect to find discussed at length online.

First, I discover Wikipedia redirects ""temporal fenestra"" to their article on skulls, which states (in a large section without citations) that ""Mammals, which are synapsids, possess no fenestral openings in the skull, as the trait has been modified."") This seems a little strange since the Wikipedia article on Therapsida -- that direct ancestors of mammals -- says they had especially large temporal fenestra, but the article on mammals also mentions nothing about temporal fenestra at all with respect to modern mammals.

Outside Wikipedia, there is surprisingly little about the evolution of the temporal fenestra in mammals. tolweb.com echoes Wikipedia, saying it has been ""drastically modified in mammals"" and ""is no longer a hole in the skull. But [there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUtvpezozh8), [are](http://campus.murraystate.edu/academic/faculty/tderting/anatomyatlas/settle3.html), [several](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQqyxWGhHWo), [other](http://bio.sunyorange.edu/updated2/comparative_anatomy/anat_3/s_temporal.htm), [sources](https://www.memorangapp.com/flashcards/7866/Anatomy+-+Feral+Cat+Skull+(Digital+Image) -- including some from higher-ed institutions -- that purport to show a ""temporal fenestra"" or ""synapsid opening"" in mammalian skulls, including human skulls.

so, decoherence actually only occurs in our internal models of reality, and objective reality is always 'quantum' / probabilistic / possibilistic. 

from another angle, why would the universe bother providing classical values for every system that happens to be observed, when it can continue to maintain everything as probabilistic functions, and it's actually consciousness that does the work of 'rendering' fundamental reality into a classical model. the rendering is outsourced to the client. it's much more efficient.

dios041,1510169991,7bnsvq,"[Old question got taken down by bot because I’d didn’t have a question mark in title, here it is again]

I’ve searched a bunch for this question but haven’t found anything quite exact to what I’m asking so I apologize if this has been asked before.

My question is this: why do electrons stay in orbitals and why do protons stay in their nucleus?

It might be a really stupid question but I had never thought about until my most recent Chem lecture. Also this might be more physics than Chem though with all the subatomic particles and charges and such.

My logic is, this. Okay so molecules will try to reach a state of stability. In methane, the hydrogens and their bond’s want to be as far apart from each other, because the electrons are all negative, and negatives don’t like other negatives.

This got me thinking. Why do the electrons stay ‘close’ to each other in orbitals if they don’t like each other? Protons are even more extreme. Why would they want to be crowded in the center like that if they hate each other? Wouldn’t the most stable state be when the protons explode out of their nucleus and find a electron to be buddies with?

My hypothesis is something like stars and planets. I thought maybe the nucleus is like a Star. A star has a fusion reaction happening inside it, which is essentially an explosion. And the reason the star isn’t exploding outward is because it’s so heavy that all the mass and the gravity from all the mass pushes it inward. So it stays ‘stable’ from the 2 forces pushing in and out. And when the reaction stops gravity gains the upper hand, yards yadda yadda, the star collapses and you get a supernova. Maybe that’s whats happening in the nucleus? Maybe there’s lots of pressure holding the repealing protons together? Maybe the neutrons do something?

And then maybe the electrons are like planets? The planets don’t fall into the sun because when they were formed from star dust they were already going around the sun, and were ‘falling’ toward the sun in a way that their outward going momentum (force making them fly off into space) was “proportional” in a way to their inward momentum (force of the sun pulling the planets in). My physics is a little rusty. I think that’s how orbiting works. Basically your outward and inward force are related in a way that you fall outward more than you’re pulled in, so you fall forward and miss the ground. Ok now to hopefully relate it to electrons.

If I remember correctly, after the Big Bang the first stuff to form were protons and nuetrons who made nuclei, and then the electrons were flying around way too fast to join in because it was about a kjghpillion degrees (sauce: https://youtu.be/xuCn8ux2gbs) and then when it cooled down, the electrons could form orbitals and make some atoms. So maybe their initial speed was the ‘right’ speed for them not to fly away but stay flying around a nucleus.

But even if the electrons orbited because they had their 2 vectors, (inward: attraction to protons, outward: they were flying around quickly) then why would the protons decide to stick? Shouldn’t the repulsion between them be stronger than the gravity pulling them together?

Is this close at all? Is there a reason for this? I’m pretty sure it’s not the same forces as planets and stars because it’s on such a micro scale, I made the connection more as an analogy. Are the micro forces I’m talking about related to the macro ones?",askscience,How do electrons and protons stay in (their orbitals)/(the neucleus) respectively?

And atoms can't form and combine together into stars while the Electroweak force is around.

musicman_97,1509736632,7aln93,"I'm currently ~~studying~~ procrastinating in a university building using over-ear headphones with white noise to block out sound. I've noticed that when I firmly tap these headphones with my finger, not only do I hear a loud thud, but I perceive a simultaneous dip in the volume of the white noise. This affects my perception of the white noise from both directions, as opposed to the direction of the tapped headphone.

This is very similar to compression used in music recording &amp; mixing. For those who don't know, compression is used to maintain a constant volume in a track - for instance, when a loud kick drum is played, it might lower the volume of the rest of the track to make it sound more smooth.

My intuition tells me that this experience is a result of the brain doing its own form of sound compression. If it were a result of the mechanics of the ear, then I would perceive  the compression to occur on the side of the headphone that's tapped, as opposed to it being directionless.

So, my question is this: is this a studied phenomenon? Does the brain compress sound just as music software does?",askscience,Does the brain compress sound?

Now, why don't modern phones do that any more? I've looked for an answer, and found some clues about why it DID that before, although I couldn't find any clear answer.

Charged particles traveling in a curved path have a [*curvature drift*](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures1/node17.html), which results in the particle having...

&gt;... a slow drift which is perpendicular to both the local direction of the magnetic field and the direction to the local centre of curvature of the field.

i.e. up or down.

Along with the myriad other drifts that charged particles undergo, one is due to an external force - in this case, [*drift due to gravity*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-611j-introduction-to-plasma-physics-i-fall-2003/lecture-notes/chap2.pdf#page=5). This could cause a drift in a couple different directions, depending on which magnetic field you look at.

Tokamaks will have both of these drifts present, and both drifts serve to drive charged particles into the wall of the reactor, which immediately causes them to lose any potential of fusion. Therefor, tokamaks are doomed to fail before they ever get the chance. Hence, [Stellarator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellarator).

I'm thinking that for a relatively small dense body, calculating its effect on another body at a relatively great distance would be a matter of calculating the effects of an infinitely small point with equal mass to the actal planet, with the same center of gravity. As if all of the mass of the planet were focused in a single mathematical coordinate in space, rather than distributed over several thousand miles of diameter. This seems like a simple equation, that the force between the 2 bodies would be calculated by their mass and distance, regardless of their respective size. 

How does this change for objects that are very close together? for example, calculating the pull of gravity of a person standing on its surface? From that distance, the distributiong of mass seems more significant, as it is not all focused in some far off single point, but distributed essentially on a plane that stretches out in every direction from the point where the person is standing, not just directly downward towards the center of the planet. Does that just get insanely complicated and a best estimate is used?

Where this could get even more interesting would be calculating the influence of 2 very large, very dense bodies with no atmosphere passing extremely close to each other in space. Like 2 massive planets moving so quickly that they pass each other within a handful of miles without colliding. If the shape of each planet was irregular, it seems the gravitational interaction of various parts of the planet and the distribution of their mass would be crucial to understanding how their respective courses would change after passing. I imagine it would go far beyond the video game approximation of a planete, which would essentially be a massless solid sphere with an infinitely small center of gravity containing all of its mass, so the force of gravity just pulls directly to the core, no matter the distance to the surface.

Another thought: how would this change the effect of gravity beneath the surface of the planet? If one were to theoretically dig a hole to the center of the earth, there would be no gravity felt except that of the sun and moon, correct? The planet's gravity would be pulling you equally in all directions from that point, essentially negating itself. 

Am I thinking of this right?

Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia run in my family, and I’ve found it interesting that my sister’s manic episodes greatly resemble my Icelandic grandma’s experiences with “elves.” Whereas my sister’s break from reality was quite traumatic, my grandma seems to have had an easy time integrating it because of her cultural surroundings.

Fizzix42,1507880256,7639hv,"Hello,

So, I think I have some guesses here, but I'm likely missing the correct search terms to feed google scholar.

When you're working with a spray, the easy assumption to make is that each drop is just a tiny sample of the bulk. If you have Xparts/L, that will just scale down to the micro or nano liter, is the hope. I trust that for the molecular level, but I'm working with something that has largish particles around the 10-30micron scale, and some sprays with a mean drop diameter around 100microns. There's a relation called Gibb's Isotherm that accounts for the ""measured excess"" at an interface in multi-component systems. That says, to me, one can expect you bulk to be somewhat inhomogenous. What does that mean for the drops one produces at an interface? Even just thinking of marangoni stresses, pinch off results in a radius of curvature one could expect to shuffle particles around.

Experimentally, the easy way to do this is probably stick beads into solution, spray on a glass slide measure drop size, evaporate, count particles. Has anyone done something like that? I cannot find it.

SecretLifeOfANerd,1507560791,759k3s,"If I had to guess, it would be some kind of algae that converts CO2 to O2 the fastest. What determines this in a plant?

EDIT: I'm going to make a TL/DR so you can get a sum of the thread in one spot without reading all the comments. **HOWEVER** please take the time to read if you can, especially if you want more information. Shoutout to /u/bbrhuft, /u/urbanek2525, /u/tea_and_biology, /u/genius_retard, and anyone else who I may have forgotten. 

Thread TL/DR: There are two different paths that a plant can take to photosynthesize: C3 and **C4**. C4 is more efficient at doing this, so the best plants for getting that carbon out of the atmosphere would be something that goes through this pathway. A good common example is a **grass** or **bamboo**.

A fast-growing plant like grass (bamboo) or algae will go through this process the fastest, but to keep the carbon locked away, it requires a fair amount of upkeep. You can't just bury the freshly cut plant because it will create methane. You will have to essentially ""burn"" it in an oxygen-free environment, creating charcoal, and then bury it away to keep that carbon out of the atmosphere (Shockingly, I didn't think of this before. Reverse the use of charcoal by... creating charcoal and burying it). The alternative to this would be planting a tree. As long as the tree is not burned, it will keep the carbon stored for a long time, with very little human input. 

This will do nothing for pollution because they aren't exactly related. One is air quality and the particles in it, one is CO2. For air quality, NASA has done a [study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Clean_Air_Study) on that topic, and has a chart of good plants to keep in your house. Top two are the peace lily and chrysanthemums, but both of them are toxic to pets. If you have a furry friend, bamboo palm is a good option.

During my physics degree, I'm sure I recall seeing an animation of a p (dumbell shaped) orbital decaying into an s (spherical) orbital by the charge distribution swaying between the two lobes of the p-orbital and eventually coming to a rest in the middle as a sphere. As the charge moves from side to side, it traces out a sine wave - the photon being emitted.  
a) Does anyone have any idea whether this is an accurate representation of electron transitions emitting photons (and presumably the opposite occurring when a photon strikes an s-orbital and excites the electron into a p-orbital)?  
My gut instinct tells me that this is pretty accurate, and fits with what I recall from quantum mechanics lectures about wave equations and so on.  
and b) Does anyone know where I could find a copy of this animation? Searching Google and YouTube only brings up unanimated diagrams showing an instantaneous ""flip"" into the other orbital shape.

Traditionally when we calculate the energy of the H atom we can partition the Hamiltonian into a kinetic energy part and a potential energy part. However when analyzing the ground state solution a cusp (singularity) appears at the position of nucleus since the potential energy goes to infinity. This cusp is ""neutralized"" by the kinetic energy which goes also to infinity at that point.  Therefore it seems t that there is something fundamentally wrong with separating kinetic and potential energy at the quantum level. Can anybody with deeper quantum physics knowledge then me chime in?

Around 4'30"", there's mention of virtual particles and a spaceship.  They move on from this idea quickly, but it got me curious.

Is there a reference frame for virtual particle production?  It seems to me that pair production generally is relatively low energy particles (the video suggests it is less common at higher energy), but the energy of a particle is relative to the observer.  Virtual particles which are low energy in one reference frame might be thought of as extremely high energy to someone traveling close to the speed of light relative to that frame.  Are virtual particles always in some particular reference frame?

I suppose another way to imagine this is to look at the Casimir effect.  If I had two close plates in a very fast rocket, oriented perpendicular to the direction of travel, the plates would be different distances apart depending on whether I am on the rocket or stationary relative to the rocket (due to Lorenz contraction).

MemeticMonstrosity,1505525171,70e68n,"The simplified explanation I was taught goes like this:

Non-gated sodium channels open following a stimulus. Once enough Na+ ions diffuse through these channels (as well as through the membrane to a lesser extent), the electrical charge reaches a threshold of -55mV, voltage-gated sodium channels also open, and the membrane depolarizes until it reaches around 30 mV. At this point, voltage-gated sodium channels close, voltage-gated potassium channels open, and K+ ion efflux repolarizes the membrane to a resting potential of -70 mV, at which point Na+/K+ pumps start to function. However, non-gated potassium channels are still open, and K+ ions are still diffusing out of the membrane through these leak channels, creating hyper-polarization. Na+ is stuck in the axon at this point, as well. The closing of the K+ channels, plus Na+/K+ pump activity, restores membrane charge to threshold, with Na+ ions on the outside and K+ ions on the inside.

This explanation seems pretty flawed to me. The Na+/K+ pump transports 3 Na+ ions out for every 2 K+ ions it transports in. If it kicks in during the refractory period, which is caused by leak channels allowing the escape of positively-charged potassium ions, wouldn't it decrease the membrane's positive charge even further by forcing 3 positively charged ions out for every 2 it pushes in? How does the membrane return to resting potential?",askscience,Could someone help fix my understanding of action potentials and the Na+/K+ pump?

To try and make it a little clear: If you put a detector far away and with a big scattering angle and count the amount of particles reaching it, you will get some counts belonging to particles with big impact parameter which were not scattered at all. On the other side, if you place the detector with no angle at all, you won't measure the amount of particles which were not deflected, because those (usually, I guess) have a big impact parameter.

Maybe I have a wrong understanding of what a scattering cross section is.

Pardon my ignorance here, but at what speeds does this occur? Say the hypothetical vehicle is moving at 75% light speed instead of 99% - is the dose of radiation less? Is it an all or nothing sort of thing or would it be the sort of thing that ramps up over time?

Say our hypothetical space ship is slowly gaining speed to approach 99% lightspeed. At what point do they start getting bombarded with this fatal radiation?

FrontColonelShirt,1504635981,6y9x4x,"Sorry if the title is misleading or confusing. I guess the tl;dr here is ""what's so special about light that it happens to travel at the speed of causality?"" Is there some intrinsic relationship between photons/particles lacking mass and causality/information? Or is this just one of those ""That's how the Universe works; we don't [yet] know why, or even if there is a particular reason"" ? Could also be a sort of chicken vs. egg question; please read on with my apologies for failing to express these thoughts concisely.

From what I understand, c (~3 x 10^8 m/s) is the speed of causality, or of information. So, if parties A and B are spacelike-separated by some distance D meters, and an event X occurs in the immediate vicinity of party A, party B cannot be aware of that event until (at the earliest) D / c seconds later. So if party B is ~9 x 10^8 meters from party A, party B cannot possibly know that the event X has occurred until *at least* 3 seconds has passed (let's say parties A and B are in the same inertial frame to avoid relativistic effects for now).

Fine; I can accept that as a physical rule of our Universe. There is some finite maximum speed at which information can propagate.

What I don't understand is why light / massless particles are so fundamentally related to causality so as to have an identical propagation speed. Is it because information can be conveyed by almost any conceivable means, so if information about an event happens to be carried by massless particles, and massless particles travel at a particular maximum speed, which happens to be the highest speed we've ever observed, we conclude that causality travels at the same speed?

If THAT preceding paragraph is true, then how do we prove that causality cannot propagate faster than c and we simply remain unaware of any means by which to test/falsify that hypothesis, since the fastest way we know to verify the propagation of causality is via (generally) EM radiation/photons?

Is this just a really extended question about the proof of the relativity of simultaneity and I'm just going about thinking about it in an extremely convoluted, flawed fashion? I am aware of the scenarios postulated showing that traveling faster than light would effectively result in traveling backwards in time, causing a paradox, but don't they all hinge upon the assumption that the speed of light *IS* the speed of causality, rather than the possibility that the speed of light is slower than the speed of causality?

I feel like I'm missing something relatively simple making this a sort of dumb question.

Maybe a better tl;dr: What is the proof that the speed of light in a vacuum is exactly equal to the speed of causality, instead of the speed of light in a vacuum potentially being slower than that of causality, even if we are unaware of any phenomena traveling faster than light (or even if no such phenomena other than causality itself exist)?

* Followup, if It is NOT, then how is the reaction maintained? How do they provide enough neutrons for a sustained and fairly constant energy production?

first of, English is not my native language, so my apologies in advance if I make any mistakes.

I'm an electrical engineering student but I haven't really understood how the electricity gets to the load with alternating current.

I know that with AC, the polarity changes (50Hz in Germany), so the electrons sort of ""vibrate"" back and forth, therefore they basically stay in the same place. 

I've read that not the electrons, but the electric field is the important factor. I just don't understand how the electric field makes the electrical load (correct term? The device that should be powered) work. How does the load get the electricity it needs?

Edit: I've read that the ""vibrating"" electrons create energy. But what kind of energy? And how does it get to the load?
Also, if the electrons aren't really ""used"" by the load, how does DC work? The electrons flow to one direction, so they have to flow ""into"" the load at some point. What happens to the electrons then?

Vedvart1,1504208853,6x99jq,"My basic understanding of the internet is as follows: information is broken down by the client into bytes and put in packets with an address, then sent onto the wires transferring them.

But surely there can't be a direct line from every single network connected to the internet straight to an ISP's servers. They must be combined somehow, but then how can all of the packets be sent to where they need to go? If they go one after another, the network gets backed up with traffic, each client waiting to see a packet for them on the wire.

""My family has this whole hypothetical question they love to bring up at every opportunity. If there's capsule floating in space and there's a pen floating around inside it and then something hits the capsule, what happens to the pen? Obviously the capsule moves but does the pen move with it or does it stay still until the capsule collides with it?
I happen to be a big space enthusiast so as far as I'm concerned, the answer is obvious. Newton's third law of physics says that objects will remain still until acted upon by an outside force. Nothing is tethering that pen to the capsule so it won't move until it hits the back of the capsule. I think most people would be able to see the logic in that. And as I said, I am positive that would happen. It's not even an opinion lol.
But my mom says that the air inside the capsule moves as one unit so when the capsule moves, so shall the interior objects.

Hottentott14,1502253464,6sj6pv,"Hello! 

I was laying in bed trying to sleep, and naturally, my brain started contemplating scientific questions. From what I've gathered, one issue with spacecraft driven by the reactive force applied on it when it ejects matter away from itself, is that it has a finite amount of matter to eject away, thus limiting the amount of movement it can generate (Δv..?). I assume that the availability of matter in outer space is quite limited (unless you find a body travelling roughly the same speed and direction as you, harvest matter from it, and use that as new matter for further acceleration), but then the idea mentioned in the title struck me. 

I mostly hear talk about converting matter into energy, but I would assume (and think I might have heard it mentioned) that there are theoretical possibilities of doing it the other way around; turning energy into matter. The famous E=mc² equation also instinctively strikes me as something you could turn on its head, though this is something I know absolutely nothing about. 

Something that there *is* an availability of in space, at least if my impressions are correct, is energy, in the form of light - or at least electromagnetic radiation. If you were to design a contraption capable of generating matter from the energy captured by the spacecraft, and then use some more of the captured energy to eject the generated matter opposite of the direction you wanted to go, would this be a (very theoretical) way of providing a spacecraft with unlimited Δv? 

I feel like I've answered some aspects of my question myself by now, but first of all I'm wondering if what I've assumed so far is correct, and if so, I'm curious about how possible this would be even on a theoretical level, and also a somewhat practical one.

I don't know much about the relations between matter and energy, but there is for example a chance that the numbers would be ridiculous. For all I know, with a solar panel the size of the Milky Way capturing 100% of the energy hitting it, and a machine converting that energy into 100% of the matter theoretically available, you would be able to accelerate 1 kg of matter 3 m/s in one direction every one billion years. Then this wouldn't be possible even on a theoretical level. This is what I'm curious about.  Is this possible at all, and if so, just *how* possible is it?",askscience,"Would it be theoretically possible to turn energy collected from solar panels into matter, before ejecting said matter through some sort of nozzle, as a way of having ""unlimited"" fuel for a spacecraft?"

Frebdignabliaq,1502250376,6six3k,"I'm not a physicist, and my formal physics education ended my freshman year in college.  That said, I still have to wonder why people refer to gravity as a ""force""?  I have been under the impression - at least since I started reading about relativity decades ago - that gravity wasn't a ""force"" (like electromagnetism and the other two quantum forces) so much as an emergent property of the curvature of spacetime.  That's why it's been so difficult to reconcile quantum theory and relativity: we're talking about apples and oranges.


The quantum forces are described as fields and seem to exist superimposed (somehow) on the larger ""canvas"" of curved spacetime.  Gravity can certainly affect the quantum forces - light bends in the presence of a strong spacetime curvature - but the quantum forces seem to have no effect whatsoever on gravity.

Kelan_,1501721648,6r8so8,"So my understanding of the twin paradox is that there are two twins, A and B, A stays on earth and B goes off on a spaceship at 99% the speed of light. From A's perspective, B is travelling at 0.99C, and so clocks on B's spaceship are running slowly, meaning B ages less. But from B's perspective, A is travelling at 0.99C in the opposite direction, meaning B sees these effects happening to A instead. From both reference frames, the other twin is ageing slower, and so the paradox asks: who has aged less when the twins are reunited.

The solution to this paradox is that B has to accelerate in order to turn around and come back home. This acceleration means that B is no longer in an inertial reference frame, and so this solves the paradox.

BUT. In a positively curved universe, you would not need to turn around and accelerate to come back home.

So I've been reading about gauge theories and the problem is, normally physics texts just assume all the geometrical data on the spacetime manifold is available. The setup of a gauge theory is a principal bundle E -> M over the spacetime manifold.

On my side, I am studying about Chern-Simons theory, which is a topological field theory known to be diffeomorphism invariant. However, the Chern-Simons action depends on the connection form. 

I have trouble putting these things together: a connection form uniquely defines a notion of parallel transport. However, parallel transport is very clearly *not* diffeomorphism invariant. I can deform the curve-to-be-lifted however I want, hell, I can even change the start and ending point via diffeomorphisms.

Sedu,1500903170,6p8dsq,"Ok, the long form of my question is a bit longer and needs some explanation. More particularly, I'm asking whether this interpretation of QP phenomenon is a valid one.

This has to do with locality/spooky action at a distance and the many universes interpretation. If we presume the many universes interpretation to be true, can't we treat our potential futures in a similar manner to the way a forward moving light one is treated at the edge of a black hole? As an observer approaches a black hole, their light cone of potential future positions shrinks. They lose potential access to regions of the universe as the cone shrinks. We do *not* interpret this as somehow altering those distant regions of space. It's the perspective of the doomed individual which is being altered. Now I'm not going to apply the *physics* of what's happening here to QP, but I am going to use the reasoning behind it.

Let's make two entangled particles and toss them to opposite ends of the galaxy. We collapse one and see that it's in an up state. If many universes is correct, then perhaps ""spooky action at a distance"" isn't communicating to the distant particle at all. Perhaps by collapsing it (and becoming entangled in a larger wave function, ourselves), we're simply cutting off our own access to futures in which our local particle's collapsed state does not match its partner's. It's simply eliminating our paths to interacting with potential futures in a similar way to the black hole diver eliminating their access to regions of space.

That takes care of observational collapse of waveforms, but doesn't require any ftl communication at all. Because it's not the distant particle that's being changed by observing the local particle, but *you the observer* that changes. It also perfectly explains why delocalized double slit experiments with delayed observations can't be used for communication. Which normally seems like the universe throwing middle fingers at us. It's an idea that I feel like other people have to have had/discussed, but I'm not really sure where to look for that, or whether it's something that's already been discarded as a possibility somehow.

Is this a reasonable way to look at QP and ""spooky action at a distance?"" I can't imagine that I'm the first person to think of this solution to eliminating the problem of nonlocality.

Anyways, the gist of what I've heard is that, if a wire inside an appliance breaks free and touches the metal container, the container of the device is now likely at the same voltage as the hot wire. Now, in theory, if I grab just a hot wire, I'm not in any danger because there's no circuit. Unless I'm also touching the return wire, there's nowhere for the current to go. Birds can stand on power lines, after all. What I've gathered, though, is that since the actual earth conducts electricity (TIL), the electricity will flow from the hot wire, through you, through the ground, and back to the power plant, which is also grounded.

What I don't understand is, if I'm inside my house, standing on a hardwood or tile floor (both insulators), wearing shoes (insulators), I'm not connected to the ground, am I? It would make sense if I was standing outside in a puddle of water, but that's not typical. Furthermore, all of this also requires that the power plant is grounded, which also makes no sense.

If it is actually a wave that emits from the atom A (imagine an expanding shell of a sphere with energy of 1 quanta ) at some point this sphere interacts with another atom (B) to excite that.  


I've got some crazy ideas which are probably not sensible but it's fun to take guesses based on limited knowledge :)

* All the energy in that sphere emitted by A is now absorbed by B so not other atoms in any direction will be excited by that shell.  This seems bizarre since I'm not sure how a directional laser can work in this setup.

* All atoms in the universe have a chance of being excited by that photon shell but based on probability where the closer it is to A the more likely the chance.  The probability is also multiplied by the crossproduct of the A-&gt;B vector and the vector the photon wave is emitted from.  This would seem to explain how lasers can work and distant starlight but would probably mean time isn't discrete but more an integral between observations?  Would also seem indicate everything is simply connected with time delays rather than light actually travelling through space.

Shooting a photon beam into a nonlinear crystal (BBO) is a method (SPDC) of creating two streams of quantum entangled photon pairs in superposition.

The first stream of particles is called stream A, the second stream is stream B.

What happens if the second stream is directed into a second BBO crystal again and one obtains two new streams of B1 &amp; B2 particle pairs?

1. are these photon pairs (B1 &amp; B2) in *super-superposition* ? how is this measured in Bell tests of the streams of particle pairs B1 &amp; B2?

2. **or** was a 'state collapse' forced onto the photon B before it was split into B1 &amp; B2?

If option 1 is valid:
do the Bell test results of the streams of B1 and B2 particles change if the particles in stream A are measured first? (likely not, correct?)

I'm a grad student with some research questions for which I want to use RNAseq, but I can't afford to send samples to a core facility, nor can the lab afford a sequencer.

If so - does that mean that if the UV cone was activated as well, the  person would just see a blueish green instead, finding the average of all three activated cones?

SunStarSight,1499787522,6mmzzz,"From the article I read:

One of the most difficult to grasp aspects of quantum physics is how observing a quantum particle forces the particle's state to change.

This is known as the observer effect, and it is the result of the instruments necessary to measure the state of very small objects.

When quantum objects, such as photons, are ""entangled"" it means that they were formed at the same instant in space and so share the same existence.

The state of entangled particles are linked, so that if you measure the state of one particle it instantaneously affects the state of the other.

Questions arise about how long it takes, if observation of one of the entangled objects can change the state of the other object, for the other object's state to change.

Current research describes entangled particles as being part of the same wave function, which means that regardless of the distance between the entangled objects, the quantum state change will take place immediately.

This form of immediate change is what is being described when the scientists talk about teleportation.

By tangling two photons together and observing one, the scientists are instantaneously transmitting information in a potentially unlimited way.

While this has been performed many times in a laboratory setting, the Chinese researcher's experiments show it to be possible to teleport an object from Earth to orbit, and breaks the record for the longest distance for entanglement.",askscience,"The first Earth-Orbit teleportation was completed today using tangled Photon observations, can someone explain how this works and how it could potentially be transitioned to matter?"

A common explaination to why an e.g. electron has a magnetic field when moving is the experiment with a wire with protons and electrons and an electron outside the wire.
Because of special relativity, the Coulomb's law experienced from the electrons point of view (the wire is moving, density of protons increases from their point of view), it must translate to a magnetic field from our point of view.

Endomorphism002,1499542391,6m2ybj,"This started by looking at the solutions to the quantum oscillator, I don't understand why the zero function cannot be a valid wave function representing something akin to a classical vacuum, i.e. a system where the expected value of detecting a particle anywhere is zero.

The first explanation I read is that the zero function is not normalizable. This seems okay, until why you remember why wave functions are normalized: to give a probability, and that the probability of finding a particle at all is certain. However, if the zero function represents a ""classical vacuum"" analogue, we should not expect to find a particle at all, and the norm of the zero function makes sense. The physical intuition that gives rise to the condition of normalization (seems like!) does not apply to the zero function.

The next explanation I have heard is that ""classical vacuum"" breaks uncertainty principles. Mathematically, this is that [x, p]=ih. But the zero function does meet this condition, since x(h d/dx) 0 - h d/dx (x*0) = ih*0. In fact, the property of the commutator above holds for any function. Our physical intuition about quantum uncertainty comes from the mathematical statement above (afaik), and the math above supports the assertion that a ""classical vacuum"" has a definite momentum of 0, which makes sense (does it?).

One thing that might undermine my support of the zero function is the expectation value of certain quantities, like the position. The expected position of the zero function is 0, which we normally interpret as the average place to find a particle. So it seems that the zero function should have a particle, on average, at x=0, which is a contradiction since the zero function is a ""classical vacuum"" with no particles. Therefore, the zero function can't represent a physical state because it gives a particle in a vacuum.

However, asking for the expected value of (position, momentum, energy) of this system is nonsensical. The zero function represents a lack of particles, so asking for the position, momentum, energy of the system doesn't work, because there are no particles that those quantities describe. So asking the expectation value of the ""classical vacuum"" doesn't make sense, so its results do not disprove the zero function.

Am I just thinking about this too clasically? I am thinking about this in terms of the Schrodinger equation and the Copenhagen interpretation. Is my understanding of observables wrong?

 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/452xla/fire_from_moonlight/), 
 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/67op9g/can_you_use_a_magnifying_glass_and_moonlight_to/) ).

But I'd like to concentrate on the main question stated in the title of this post since I think this is already hard enough to answer without being distracted by things like ignition points, practical losses by absorption of light in the atmosphere or trying to fit a mirror around the sun.

I have 2 situations in particular:

Say a photon is emitted of a (relatively) cold object. This photon then collides with a hot object. Why wouldn't this photon be absorbed by the hot object (and making it hotter)? The 2nd law of thermodynamics is often mentioned. Heat cannot flow from a cold object to a hot object. But is this still applicable if you are using light for the energy transfer? How would an emitted photon know how hot it's source was and why/how would it be prevented being absorbed by a hotter object? A photon is a photon right? 

The second situation:

You could also think about the following (theoretical) set-up:
2 perfectly absorbing and irradiating black bodies placed at the focal points of an ellipsoid perfect mirror.

Both bodies will be at an equilibrium when left alone long enough. The equilibrium could be described by the [Stefan-Boltzman Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law). Which would result in the following formula:

    A₁*T₁⁴=A₂*T₂⁴

And if the surface areas (A₁ and A₂) are not equal then the result would be that the temperatures (T₁ and T₂) are also not equal.

My gut feeling says ""of course this is not possible"" but I cannot poke a hole through these two situations I've just described. I'd love to hear your theories on this.

√x + √(x+15) = 15

My solution was simple: I assumed that x and (x+15) were both perfect squares, and given that the distance between the *nth* and *nth+1* perfect square is always 2n+1, it was immediately obvious that n=7 and x was 49.  No big deal, not a hard problem.

Basically the TLDR is that charging your phone is quicker when the battery is lower because as the battery fills up, it becomes harder to 'squash' the energy into the battery. [A fun *somewhat* related video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MenKyfGvtvk)

So today I received a portable phone charger / power bank, which will most definitely come in handy when on road trips or when I'm away from a power supply. 

Based on the answers / explanations in the previous thread, would I be right to assume that if the phone charges quicker at a lower %, it would be more efficient to only use the power bank when the battery % is sub 20% and then stop at around 50%? Or will the same amount of energy be lost from the power bank regardless?

For example if it takes me 5 minutes to charge the phone from 10% -&gt; 50% and it also takes me 5 minutes to charge from 90% -&gt; 95%, would both scenarios deduct the same amount of energy from the power bank even though the lower % is being increased by almost 8 times the amount than at the higher %?

Bonus question:
If the same amount of energy is taken from the power bank i.e 10% -&gt; 50% and 90% -&gt; 95% both consuming X amount of mAh (energy) within 5 minutes, does this mean the power between 95 -&gt; 90% of the battery actually lasts 8 times as long as the battery between 15% -&gt; 10%?

Why is it that there are so many instances of parallel evolution and seemingly no instances of game ending mutations that leave the opponent with no chance to counter before the species goes extinct in a few generations?

For instance, there hasn't been any virus in the past billion years that has successfully evolved a way to destroy all life. When a prey animal evolves camouflage and the predator evolves better eyes, at no point does a random mutation on the part of the prey happen to make it completely invisible to the predator, causing the predator to go extinct before it can evolve the necessary eyes to see the prey again. Imagine the devastation that would occur if a strain of grass in Africa evolves toxins or spines, yet it hasn't happened in the time it took dinosaurs to evolve into chickens and many other plants to evolve spines.

PURELY_TO_VOTE,1498762785,6kaif0,"This is from *Black Holes &amp; Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy*, Box 2.4: Gravitational Time Dilation.

Note: I'm not disputing the fact that gravity dilates time, I'm actually trying to understand how the author thinks the following example demonstrates anything at all.

The author, Kip Thorne, attempts to demonstrate gravitational time dilation using a thought experiment from the perspective of special relativity. But there's a leap in logic that I'm completely missing. Here is the relevant bit:

&gt; [...] Because the ceiling clock was dropped before the floor clock, its downward speed is always greater than that of the floor clock (diagram b); that is, it moves toward the floor clock. This implies that the floor clock will see the ceiling clock’s light pulses Doppler-shifted (Box 2.3); that is, it will see them arrive more closely spaced in time than the time between its own ticks. Since the time between pulses was regulated by the ceiling’s time flow, and the time between floor-clock ticks is regulated by the floor’s time flow, this means that time must flow more slowly near the floor than near the ceiling; in other words, *gravity must dilate the flow of time.*

But...none of this has anything to do with gravity. The logic appears to be:

* Ceiling clock is moving towards floor clock.
* Therefore Floor clock sees Doppler-shifted light pulses from Ceiling clock.
* Therefore Floor clock measures the Ceiling clock as running faster than floor clock.
* Therefore Gravity warps time! (???)

What's so confusing is that this has nothing to do with gravity. Sure, gravity produced motion in the ceiling clock, but you'd get the exact same motion with magnetic clocks in a magnetic field or electrically charged clocks or by just shoving the ceiling clock in space. In fact, by having both clocks be fairly close to each other and both in free fall so that ""Einstein’s equivalence principle ... permitted him to compare the ticks of the freely falling clocks with the aid of his special relativistic laws"", Thorne appears to go to some length to demonstrate that all this could happen within the purview of Special Relativity and actually doesn't *require gravity at all* to make perfect sense.

This makes the last sentence is just baffling to me. ",askscience,Gravitational Time Dilation example from Thorne's book: What logical leap am I missing?
crappyroads,1498760853,6kaahu,"I work with a device called a PQI that measures the dielectric constant of bulk asphalt to determine its density. As water has a high dielectric constant relative to the other materials in HMA (hot mix asphalt), it must be subtracted from the measurements. The way the device does this is by alternating the voltage applied and measuring the phase angle of the HMA's response. 

Normally this works pretty well. However, there is one supplier of HMA in particular in my region that results in very strange readings on the device. Instead of the device returning 2.5-6.0 percent water (note: this is not the actual water content of the asphalt. It's more like a signature that tells us the density reading we're seeing is valid), it returns anywhere from 9-15 percent water.

Interestingly, this is largely temperature dependent. As the temperature drops, so does the measured water content.

Distances are increasing between distant objects but nothing is in motion. That is why we have concepts like cosmological red shift (caused by the universe expanding and NOT by motion) and the Co-moving coordinate system which depicts the universe as essentially static.

Am I missing something? 

I know that there is never zero motion. However, on the scale of the universe the motions of stars in a galaxy or galaxies in a cluster are like the motions of atoms within a diamond (or not?)

Obviously, gravitational wells slow time, but so does approaching the speed of light relative to someone else. This got me thinking about the twin paradox scenario, and I noticed a few steps.

* 1 - Both twins start in Earth's reference frame with its rate of time.
* 2 - Then one twin begins accelerating away from Earth.
* 3 - This twin reaches a maximum velocity, which is held constant for a while, meaning no acceleration.
* 4 - Then the extraterrestrial twin begins accelerating toward Earth.
* 5 - Eventually the twin is no longer moving with respect to Earth, presumably matching Earth's rate of time, ignoring the effects of Earth's gravity well for simplicity.
* 6 - To return to Earth, the twin does step 4, then 3, then 2, before returning to Earth where the sibling is now older.

Somewhere between steps 1 and 5, the travelling twin's rate of time is slower than the Earth twin's rate of time. But, what are the individual rates of time in steps 2, 3, and 4? My guess is that steps 2 and 4 have slower rates of time because of the acceleration, but that step 3 matches Earth's rate of time. I say this because it's the same as the scenario with the two non-accelerating astronauts moving past one another in the void. When comparing the perspectives of each twin in either case of step 3 (growing distance or shrinking distance), neither one can say for sure that they are stationary and the other one is moving, so there's no reason that the either one should have a slower rate of time than the other. Or am I missing something?

However, I just read in 'Death by Black Hole,' by Neil DeGrasse Tyson, the VAST majority of light from a star is only created in the core, and a single photon, on average, can take up to a MILLION YEARS to complete it's journey from the core to the surface where it can finally travel outward unimpeded.

When the primary coil is brought near the component to be tested, the changing excitation field induces circular eddy currents in the surface of the component. This eddy current in turn produces a magnetic field in such a way as to oppose the changing excitation flux. The reduction in the resultant field strength will change the coil impedance. But how?

The language of computers is in 1s and 0s, right? And so to correctly represent the universe, you'd need a mechanism which represents yes/no. The best I could come up with was elections which have a up or down spin with one representing 1, the other representing 0. However, in such a system, the amount of electrons would be insufficient to represent the information necessary to simulate our universe assuming that the 'real' universe is the size of our universe and has the same laws of physics/particles.

With only electron spin, though, you could store only the up or down spin of the electron in the simulation, so the best you could simulate is a universe with an equivalent amount of electrons, but only their spin all at once. Nothing about their location, velocity, size, charge.  

Then I realized that what I'm describing isn't really how the universe works. There's uncertainty. Einstein says that God Doesn't Play Dice, and the consensus I've always seen is that he's actually wrong about that.

If I lived on a torus planet where the cross-section of the torus was the diameter of the earth and the hole in the middle of the torus was around the distance from the earth to the moon. Assuming the torus is not rotating so no artificial gravity. Where would gravity pull me towards? My slightly educated guess would be the center of mass of the torus.

If this is the case then my follow up question would be, if gravity is weaker over distance, could I increase the size of this torus to the point where I would no longer be pulled to the centre?

Edit: I'd like to do a reverse question because a lot of people are saying that I would be pulled towards the surface of the Torus, is there a scenario where the pull to the centre of mass is greater than the pull to the surface?

da_neo,1497661179,6hqm0q,"Recently there was a discussion between me and my friends and we had a little disagreement about the colour of molten iron. (All beginning with this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E6TzT0eCYs)

To my understanding: Every object ""glows"" the same colour at the same temperature. Beginning from red through orange to white depending on how hot they are.

Now Iron has a melting point of 1.538 °C. According to wikipedia things should begin to glow white at around 1500°C. 
Now like the video said molten iron has to be a little bit hotter than the melting point or else it would solidify ""instantly"" when you try to pour it. 

So even if the white glowing doesn't happen straight at 1500°C, molten iron, in order to pour it, should be a lot hotter and be white.


So here is my question: Why is the colour of molten iron in movies or book descriptions or even when you google ""molten iron pictures"" always bright orange?
Shouldn't it be at least yellow?

asphias,1497432272,6h6ebn,"I'm often fascinated by alternatives to rocket launches, and how viable they would be - space elevator, launch loop, etc. However, for some of these ideas, a big obstacle is the earth atmosphere - for example, using a Linear induction motor in a vacuum tube to accelerate up to orbital speed would leave you with a rocket at low altitude, which then still has to punch through the atmosphere before arriving in space.

Now when a spacecraft re-enters the atmosphere, it uses the atmosphere as a breaking mechanism strong enough to land safely on earth, and it already uses the upper part of the atmosphere for much of the speed reduction. This would suggest *bad things*^TM would happen to a spacecraft going orbital speeds at sea level.

However, spacecraft are usually aerodynamically designed specifically to use the atmosphere for breaking, rather than trying to minimize drag and punch through the atmosphere. 

So thats my question - Would a spacecraft launched with orbital speeds(in the range of 6-10 km/s) designed with minimizing aerodynamic drag be capable of escaping the atmosphere intact? Would it still have a reasonable amount of speed left?(as in, would it leave the atmosphere with 90% of its original speed, or 10% of its original speed?)

Avoid-The-Clap,1497214871,6gnt3r,"Howdy,

I'm reading Neil de Grasse Tyson's ""Astrophysics for People in a Hurry,"" and he writes something that is driving me nuts regarding the size of the very early universe.

For those not familiar with the book, the opening chapter starts with the Big Bang, and takes you through all of the things that are happening with quarks, leptons, hadrons, etc. He describes all these things and says stuff like, ""A billioninth of a second has passed."" It's a very compelling literary tool.

But then he writes this: ""By now, one second of time has passed. The universe has grown to a few light-years across...""

Here's what is bothering me: if only a second of time has passed, how could the universe have expanded to a few light years across? How could any of those early particles have traveled further than a light second?

AdMikey,1497199491,6gmcvt,"So on a continuous clock, as in the hands move continuously in circular motion instead of ""ticking"" and skips a gap, will the three hands ever be perpendicular to each other? As in any two of the hands are at 180 degrees and the third one is perpendicular to both hands. 

I tried to solve it using vectors. I assumed the clock is a unit circle, and the three hands all have length of 1 unit, therefore the hands can be described by trig vectors in relation to time. I assumed that the second (**s**) and the minute hands (**m**) are parallel at the instant, and using the rules of dot product, |**s** • **m**| = |**s**||**m**|, but as **s** and **m** are unit vectors, |**s** • **m**|=1. Then the hour hand (**h**) has to be perpendicular to both of them, therefore **h**•**s**=**h**•**m**=0.

But **h**•**s**=**h**•**m**=0 and |**s** • **m**|=1 are two long trig equation where the variable t can be anything between 0 and 43200 (I wrote the position vectors in terms of seconds, and there are 43200 seconds in 12 hours). Each has a ton of solutions and it's incredibly difficult to find a common result, also the other combinations (hour is parallel to minute hand, hour is parallel to second hand) have to be tried, which makes the process more difficult.

I'm wondering whether there's an easier way to solve for this problem, or if there's a way to solve my equations. Note it's possible that the equations may have no solutions, which means that there isn't an instant in time where the second and minute hands are at 180 degrees while the hour hand is perpendicular to both. Also, if there is no solution on a continuous clock, are there solutions for a discontinuous clock? As in the hands only point at the 60 markings directly and never at the gaps between them.

For those interested here are my position vectors for the hands:

* **s**=[cos(90 - 6t), sin(90 - 6t)]
* **m**=[cos(90 - t/10], sin(90 - t/10)]
* **h**=[cos(90 - t/120], sin(90 - t/120)]

Surely that is enough to ensure pretty much negligable amounts of carbon on earth. According to wikipedia, 1-1.5 per 10^12 cabon atoms are carbon 13 or 14.

So if this is the case for something with a half life as long as carbon 14, then how the hell are their still radioactive elements/isotopes on earth with lower half lives? How do we still pick up trace, but still appreciable, amounts of radioactive elements/isotopes on earth?

Is it correct to assume that no new radioactive particles are being produced on/in earth? and that they have all been produced in space/stars? Or are these trace amount replenished naturally on earth somehow?

I recognize that the math checks out, and that we should still be picking up at least some traces of them. But if you were to look at it from the perspective of a individual Cesium or Phosphorus-32 atoms it seems so unlikely that they just happen to survive so many potential opportunities to just decay and get entirely wiped out on earth.

Let's say we observe from our rest frame that light was emitted in all directions equally by the moving light bulb. The net momentum on the light bulb would be null relative to the box. The momentum on the box is a different story.  Light moving straight up (y+) in our frame is actually moving somewhat left (mix of y+ and x- direction) in the frame of the box.  Most of the light in this case would have some x- momentum relative to the box.  

So, maybe my assumption here was wrong.  We'd expect the light to be evenly distributed across the box in the box's frame, so maybe we should assume we see this happen from our rest frame.  So let's start over.  If instead we start with the assumption that light energy is evenly distributed across the box, then the momentum on the box would be null.... However, in order to make this happen, I see a similar momentum discrepancy as the one I saw in the previous scenario, except the problem here is with the momentum on the light bulb.  In order to observe an equal distribution of light across the box from our rest frame, we'd have to see most of the energy leave the light bulb in the x+ direction.  In order to hit each position of the box equally with light, most of the light would have to be emitted moving away from us along the x axis in the same direction the box is moving.. This would mean most of the momentum on the light bulb would have to be in the x- direction, as most of the light is emitted in the x+.  So, in this case, there is a non null momentum on the light bulb.

So in one case, the momentum on the light bulb would be null but the momentum on the box would be x-.  In the other case, the momentum on the box would be null, but the momentum on the light bulb would be x-.  Either scenario would seem to require that the box should slow down, from the perspective of our rest frame.  

What am I missing here?

Here is the abstract: 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22215165

**Effect of dietary protein content on weight gain, energy expenditure, and body composition during overeating: a randomized controlled trial.**

**CONTEXT:**

The role of diet composition in response to overeating and energy dissipation in humans is unclear.

**OBJECTIVE:**

To evaluate the effects of overconsumption of low, normal, and high protein diets on weight gain, energy expenditure, and body composition.

**DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:**

A single-blind, randomized controlled trial of 25 US healthy, weight-stable male and female volunteers, aged 18 to 35 years with a body mass index between 19 and 30. The first participant was admitted to the inpatient metabolic unit in June 2005 and the last in October 2007.

**INTERVENTION:**

After consuming a weight-stabilizing diet for 13 to 25 days, participants were randomized to diets containing 5% of energy from protein (low protein), 15% (normal protein), or 25% (high protein), which they were overfed during the last 8 weeks of their 10- to 12-week stay in the inpatient metabolic unit. Compared with energy intake during the weight stabilization period, the protein diets provided approximately 40% more energy intake, which corresponds to 954 kcal/d (95% CI, 884-1022 kcal/d).

**MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:**

Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry biweekly, resting energy expenditure was measured weekly by ventilated hood, and total energy expenditure by doubly labeled water prior to the overeating and weight stabilization periods and at weeks 7 to 8.

**RESULTS:**

Overeating produced significantly less weight gain in the low protein diet group (3.16 kg; 95% CI, 1.88-4.44 kg) compared with the normal protein diet group (6.05 kg; 95% CI, 4.84-7.26 kg) or the high protein diet group (6.51 kg; 95% CI, 5.23-7.79 kg) (P = .002). Body fat increased similarly in all 3 protein diet groups and represented 50% to more than 90% of the excess stored calories. Resting energy expenditure, total energy expenditure, and body protein did not increase during overfeeding with the low protein diet. In contrast, resting energy expenditure (normal protein diet: 160 kcal/d [95% CI, 102-218 kcal/d]; high protein diet: 227 kcal/d [95% CI, 165-289 kcal/d]) and body protein (lean body mass) (normal protein diet: 2.87 kg [95% CI, 2.11-3.62 kg]; high protein diet: 3.18 kg [95% CI, 2.37-3.98 kg]) increased significantly with the normal and high protein diets.

**CONCLUSIONS:**

Among persons living in a controlled setting, calories alone account for the increase in fat; protein affected energy expenditure and storage of lean body mass, but not body fat storage.

ladyboner_22,1496777887,6fo6hj,"Hello, I recently went to a church and spoke to a pastor who did talk to me about how evolution is simply both mathematically and scientifically impossible due to the fact that it's improbable that the Earth was not created by something and that particles can't just come together and create the universe. That molecules and atoms can't just spontaneously form to create life. 


He also said that evolution and natural selection would be impossible and all the ""proof"" available to the people are all lies and/or does not exist. He states that that Lucy (the Australopithecus) was simply an ape that was presented as an early human ancestor. He also said that Cro-magnon Man was a homo-sapien because the tools found could only be created by homo-sapiens and that since Cro-magnon Man had a skull case bigger than modern humans and therefore a bigger brain which that means that it's impossible for Cro-magnon Man to be anything but a modern human because it doesn't make sense that an early human ancestor has a bigger brain than us. 


I have always been an evolutionist but the pastor's comments have influenced me to look elsewhere and I want to do my due diligence in finding the truth based on evidence/the reasoning behind theories.


Obviously the pastor I spoke to is a godly-man and believes that God is our creator but I don't think I can do that until all the facts are laid in front of me and then I can make my decision on what to believe.

But let's say the source material is an analog film reel, or a feed from a cheap security camera that happened to write uncompressed RAW images to disk at 30fps.

This makes the problem not much different from how the human eye works. The retina is actually pretty low-res, but because of ultra fast eye movements ([saccades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade)) and oversampling in the brain, our field of vision has remarkable resolution.

Is there an algorithm that treats RAW source material as ""highest compression possible"", and can display it ""decompressed"" - in much greater detail?

Because while each frame is noisy and grainy, the data visible in each frame is also recorded in many, many consecutive images after the first. Can those subsequent images be used to carry out some type of oversampling in order to reduce noise and gain pixel resolution digitally?

1) What's the difference between a linear transformation and a tensor? Somehow they can both be represented by a 3x3 matrix, but they do different things when acting on a vector? Like the columns of a 3x3 matrix of a linear transformation tell you where the basis vectors end up, but the same columns of a tensor don't represent basis vectors at all?

2) Furthermore, a linear transformation transforms all of space but a tensor is defined at every point in space? Does a tensor act on vectors the same way as linear transformations do?

3) What the heck is the difference between a tensor product, dyadic product, and outer product and why are engineering tensors like the Cauchy stress built from the tensor product of two vectors (i.e. traction vector and basis vectors).

4) Is it true that scalars and vectors are just 0th order and 1st order tensors, respectively? How are all these things related to each other?

I have plenty more questions, but I figure the answers to these could already be enough to fill a whole textbook. Just to note, I have already searched reddit for tensors but have't found any explanations that make any sense to me yet.

mgatten,1496353758,6eq3dh,"Consider two extremely massive black holes hurtling through space towards each other at relativistic speed. They are not orbiting one another. Their velocities are such that their event horizons will overlap at least a little bit when they pass one another.  

Is it possible for them to not merge into a single black hole? (Even if they would curve into an orbital trajectory and be fated to merge on a subsequent pass, I'm asking if they can they get past that first pass without merging.)  

If so, could they exchange matter from inside their event horizons?  

Might their passage actually rip some matter or energy out of each other, leaving it in normal space outside of both their event horizons?

Thanks to the video that was on the front page a few days ago, I was recently introduced to the work of Dr. Russell Barkley. Much of what he said about ADHD being primarily an impairment of executive function sounded like it made a lot of sense, and it matched up very well with my own experience of my disability. Is this a well established theory of the cause and nature of ADHD? Is it well supported by the work of other researchers, or is Dr. Barkley on the fringe?

Or in the respiratory system where the diaphragm and other muscles create negative pressure by expanding the thorax, causing air to flow into the lungs. 

Moving away from the human body, and to the ocean, there is a pressure difference created by gravity. Water at the bottom of the ocean is at much higher pressure than the water at the surface. So why doesn't the water at the bottom keep flowing up towards the surface?

The heart produces pressure, and a sphygmomanometer around your arm, at the level of your heart, can tell you what this pressure is. But gravity does some work too.

To start off, I originally started drawing some still life, a lit candle. I thought it might be good to draw a moving subject (the flame.)

http://imgur.com/eiND4RO 

I colored in the candle, drawing how I perceived it, and then added in the flame, how I perceived it.

Well, looking at that, the fire doesn't look very bright at all, the colors matched the candle, and when I look at the flame, definitely see color in it as well.

So as an artist, I thought this might be a good challenge to make the flame LOOK bright without taking a photo and using that.

http://imgur.com/8rNl3tg

I got to here before I started getting too confused, I couldn't really tell If The flame's color was more or less vibrant than the color of the candle. So I figured maybe I could tell a bit better through a photo.

http://imgur.com/4pMPFty

Well, now I remembered that since the brightest thing in the picture is technically the flame, therefore it SHOULD be white on paper, but yet when I look at the flame, it doesn't look white to me?

http://imgur.com/lFrbNWk

So I focused the camera away from the flame, the colors and values of the area matched how I see it, but now the flame itself is barely visible. Why is this?

Tldr;

Why can I see color within the flame AND the color of the surrounding area, but the camera can't?

When we see a new disease outbreak that kills massive amount of population can cause alarm, do those animals population ultimately adjust back having developed certain immunity?

So if the beehive collapses we see are due to some disease, could we expect long term recovery without our intervention by spread of stronger resistance to the disease within the bee species?",askscience,"In a massive disease outbreak, do animal species come out with stronger immunity?

guferr,1495860617,6dlwp7,"EM waves must be transverse because of the way the oscillations on electric and magnetic fields perpetuate each other as they propagate from the source.

However, even without this mechanism, imagine this: 

You have two eletrically charged spheres near each other, each one being held on their place by a spring that allows them to move in the direction in which they are aligned (see drawing below).

[Here's the drawing of it](http://i.imgur.com/Jz4OKI2.png)
(this would be the system in the equilibrium state)(sorry for being lazy to draw the electric fields)

The electric field both produces is strong enough to cause the other to oscillate if you move one of them. And then, you pull one of them, making it oscillate and making both work as oscillators coupled by the electric field. 

In this scenario, the variation of the field (that corroborates with the motion) occurs in the same direction they oscillate. And as nothing can propagate instantaneously, this oscillations must propagate through the space between both.

So, it's an oscilation in the electric field, that's propagating between them and transfering energy from one to other. 

Why can't it be considered as an wave? Even if in a small scale, as it decays rapdly as the distance increases, differently from an transverse EM wave (like the very-low energy transverse EM waves that they would be producing during this). 

Other scenario i could propose to simply talk about the longitudinal variation of electric field would be the field in the front of an flat charged surface (like a thin metal sqare) as you change it's charge, making it positively and then negatively charged.",askscience,May longitudinal eletric field oscillations be considered EM waves?
sid_lordoftheflame,1495859097,6dlt18,"I heard in conversation a while ago that if you have a 100-character message string encoded with a 100-character key string of randomized characters, then there's no way to decrypt without the key. Since they key is 100% random and unknown, each character is exactly as likely to be any character, causing no discernible patterns to form in the encoded message.

To explain in simplified form, in case I'm not using terms correctly (no knowledge of cryptology beyond anecdote):

Message: 1122334455
Randomized Key: 9403609884
(add digits to encode)
Encoded message: 0525933239

Because the key is a randomized set of digits, the encoded message (without the key) is equally likely to be any of the 10-billion 10-digit strings, if I'm thinking through this correctly.

* Is this actually the case? 

And then, ancillary questions (I don't really see any rules against these, they're just sort of where my mind goes when I think about this situation, feel free to answer or ignore if they're too much.)

* How secure is a 100-character message encoded with, this time, a randomized but repeating 10-character key? 

* Does the ""key length-to-message length"" ratio affect the situation in any quantifiable way?

But iterations of one type of hardware - especially if they are the same brand and/or form factor - tend to look the exact same, externally.

Extra question: How is it that the universe is expanding? I have a big theory on this but how is it that we can measure the expansion of the universe?? That doesn't make any sense to me because if the universe is expanding we are also expanding, how can we know that what we percieved as 10 meters is now 20 meters if our instruments for measures also expanded and our own body, mind, eyes, atoms, and even the photons in the universe also expanded?

I say this cause scientists say the universe expands faster than the speed of light... 

Extra extra bonus final boss easy question

How can something not pass the speed of light if the momentum formula is f=m.v being f force, m mass and v volume. To move something of 1 kg faster than the speed of light you need more newtons than speed of light, does a newton always take the same energy to achieve or does one newton take more energy in relation to the one that was applied before??

I did some research and it appears from the few minutes I looked into it that brake rotors develop high and low spots due to uneven brake pad wear which causes the pulsation you feel as the driver if there is a problem. According to the research I did because the brake rotors are manufactured at extremely high temperatures they are impervious to the heat generated by the act of braking meaning that if there is an issue causing a pulsation it must be due to something other than a warped rotor. I like many other mechanics have been describing this issue incorrectly for my entire career according to what I read. That aside I got to thinking, why is it that brake rotors can't warp from the act of braking but cylinder heads can warp from overheating? The typical temperature of the coolant in the engine during normal operation is about 200 to 240 degrees Fahrenheit the actual temperature of the metal in the engine I'm not sure of but I would guess it's in the 300-500 Fahrenheit range. I would also guess that during a severe overheat the temperature might double or triple but not reach the temperature of the manufacturing process.

Pyrothei,1495476438,6coxm3,"So I have a basic understanding of chemistry and physics, and I know that the fundamental difference between elemental atoms comes down to particles like electrons and further down like quarks. I know reactivity plays a large role in how elements behave and the number of electrons is relevant to how reactive an element is in relation to others via sharing electrons.

So my questions boil down to:

How is it that with just different numbers of particles in an atom, any given element can be so radically different? Helium is ""smaller"" than Lead, and it is a gas and makes your voice funny and Lead is a heavy metal that makes you sick. But iron is also ""smaller"" but it's also a solid and is a required part of the body as a mineral?

Based on this, is it possible that a theory could be put together to predict an elements properties just via information contained in the Periodic Table? 

I'm aware of the Island of Stability. If we know of helium and iron with great certainty, and we understand how different they are, how much different might exotic superheavy elements behave? Do we have a hope of predicting this? From what we know currently, are any of those exotic materials anything more than radioactive death particles?

I know that Sci Fi likes to play with ideas about a universal source code and such, but if we were to understand the base make up of all things, would there be a limit to what we could do/understand?

Or lets say the tube isn't spinning at all, the astronaut positions him-/herself in the dead center of the pipe, then someone turns the thing on. How does the astronaut gain velocity? Or does he/she?

Some clarifications: 

1. The astronaut doesn't touch anything (walls etc.) and there's no air (no chained contact through air molecules to the structure)

2. The astronaut is inside and in the dead center of the tubular structure moving around him/her, like the astronaut was going through a tunnel.

3.  Everything has a gravitational pull (Law of gravitation). How does this force behave in this situation since the object is all around the astronaut and constantly moving?

InfiniLED MicroLEDs achieve 300 W/cm2 output density from tiny source.
The MicroLEDs semiconductor manufacturing process includes construction of a parabolic reflector to enable optimal light control and high efficiency from micro-meter-sized LEDs.
Published on:Jan 29, 2013
By Maury Wright

http://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/2013/01/infiniled-microleds-achieve-300-w-cm-sup-2-sup-output-density-from-tiny-source.html

and:

Optical communications using coherent and non-coherent light.

http://modulatedlight.org/optical_comms/optical_about.html


 The first report discusses micro-scale LED's whose light output scales up to 300 W per square centimeter, 3 megawatts per meter. From the appearance of these micro-scale LED's, they should permit simple automated production to produce many copies to cover a macro-scale area to generate light even at gigawatt power levels.


 The second report discusses experimentation that suggests atmospheric dispersion is actually worse for lasers than for noncoherent light generated by LED's. See for instance the video in Fig. 2 on this page.


 The advantage of the lasers however is that generating a parallel beam, you can use a parabolic mirror to focus the light at the focal point (more precisely at the Airy disk). Still, nevertheless a parabolic mirror will still focus a large portion of the light at the focal point even for noncoherent light.


So the question is if the beam is noncoherent, how much of the light can still be focused at the focal point (Airy disk)?

I'm not saying that the object has escape velocity while within the event horizon, but before it reaches it. Like, if you fall towards the Earth from ""very high"" and ""very fast"" [1] but avoid to hit it (or its atmosphere), you will pass by and be flung back ""very high"" and ""very fast"" (a hyperbolic trajectory) and conservation of energy will not have been violated. Your kinetic + potential energy will always be the same.

The higher you hang the IV-bag with chemo, the higher the pressure in the line, the higher the pressure in his kidney. High pressure is BAD for kidneys. Therefore the guidelines state that the IV-bag shouldnt be hung to high (40-50cm max).

It's a little wheel that you can adjust to vary the amount of drops that fall into the dripchamber. Assume the lower half of the line stays at the same height and the amount of fluidpressure doesnt change due to an emptying IV-bag. 

If the IV is hung twice as high but the flowregulator is squeezed so tight that the flowrate (amount of drips) stays the same. Doesnt that mean that the pressure beyond the flowregulator is the same in both instances?

TheWalruss,1494498526,6aj9rs,"There's a guy on reddit who insists that the Lense-Thirring effect (L-T) somehow causes the orbital plane of a planet to align with the equatorial plane of the (rotating) star about which the planet orbits. Similarly, the orbital plane of a moon would align itself with the equatorial plane of its host planet, assuming the planet is spinning. He cites [this paper](http://philica.com/display_article.php?article_id=281) to support his thesis.

From what I've read about L-T, [this is not the case](https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9704065.pdf): the orbital inclination, or the angle between the orbital plane and the equatorial plane, remains the same. However, the orbital plane precesses about the axis of rotation of the star. And there's also nodal precession, too, but that also doesn't affect the angle of the orbital plane.

The one case where L-T *does* result in something aligning itself with the equatorial plane is [in the accretion disks of Kerr black holes](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1975ApJ...195L..65B): if (for some reason) an accretion disk forms that is out of alignment with a fast-rotating black hole, L-T causes the the orbital planes at different distances to precess at different rates, which causes shearing in the viscous mass of the accretion disk, and as the disk relaxes into a lower energy state, it will end up in the same plane as the plane of rotation of the black hole. But this is due to internal friction within the disk, and that is not a significant factor in ordinary orbital mechanics involving stars, planets, moons, and even rings.

Is he right, or am I? Or are we both wrong?

Wyleyia is known by a single worn humerus. Gallornis is known by a femur and a humerus. Is that enough to build consensus on the origin of birds? How is this grouping of birds defined?

callmecraycray,1494160962,69r3rt,"After reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system I saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation (due to its magnetism).

Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.

Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.

So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.

Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.

So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.

Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?

Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.

The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.

Does that kinda summ it up?",askscience,"If iron loses its magnetism at around 1400°F, how is the earths core magnetic?"

Fellainis_Elbows,1494077972,69l8do,"Ok so first off, in school the electron is treated as if it has a specific radius. Obviously this isn't a proper representation of an electron because you can't properly define it. I was looking into electromagnetic dipoles and found that the magnetic dipole moment of an electron can be explained to be the consequence of its ""spin"", which is analogous to the spinning of a sphere in classical mechanics but isn't the same. I read that you can't treat it classically because an electron is really zero-dimensional and is a point-like particle and so doesn't have an axis on which to spin. So my question is basically which is it? Does an electron have a ""size"" or is it point-like? 

Also as a side note, could someone tell me if the way I visualise an electron probability cloud is in any way accurate? So let's say you can be 70% sure that the electron is within a certain radius and 30% certain that it's within a larger radius. Can you treat it as though it's properties are spread out so that 70% of its properties (e.g mass, charge) are within the smaller radius and 30% effect the larger radius? Kind of like the electron is a cloud of gas which is more concentrated in the centre and therefore has more interactions there than further out.

erwincole,1493597136,68isj5,"Hello, I asked this question on /r/askastronomy, but I can't seems to understand more about it. I hope I can found a teacher to point out my mistake in my conception on how the curve of space time work. I'm not a science student but I like Astronomy and studied the topic from wiki and popular science sources. 

I stumbled upon this when I read how Uranus maintain it's orientation when it orbit the sun. I have always thought that one side of the Uranus' pole is always facing the sun whenever it's position is with in it's orbit. However, that is not the case. As Uranus travel to the opposite side of it's orbit, the other side of the pole is facing the sun instead. This is shocking for me because it's mean my understanding of the curvature of spacetime is wrong. Even more so as I remember how the season on Earth works as it travel the orbit during equinox and solstice, I have not see this discrepancy in my brain for this long.

As I understand it, if an stationary object falling through an object gravity well, it's like a straight line being bend to curve around the object. To make this easier to understand how I thought it works, imagine a bending ruler. First, you place the ruler as a horizontal straight line, and put an object that is facing upward. As it travel down this straight line, the object is always facing up. As you bend the ruler to form a circle, the travelling object will always be facing the center. 

Reality is gravity well didn't change the object orientation, but only changes it's path. As I tried to applied this to my understanding of how spacetime curve, in the perspective as the object is falling though straight line, it seems as if the object is rotating on it's equator. I have prepared an [**IMAGE**](http://i.imgur.com/9o6ec2a.png) to illustrate this.

Obviously, my brain interpret geometry curvature of space in a wrong way. I can't seems to understand how the space is curve yet the object orientation doesn't curve along with it. In the case of visualising gravity well as trampoline, I thought, as ball rolls towards the center, it's pole is always facing the center.

I assume my post is confusing because of the way how I see curvature of space works, which is not correct. I tried my best to explain my situation of the problem, so please do ask anything if some parts seems confusing.

sangstar,1493255277,67sfvl,"I have two questions, a main one (title) and a side question I added.

1) The first one has to do with the formula for deriving Gravitational Potential Energy. I learned that, for the derivation of Gravitational Potential Energy given large distances, we have to use the mathematical analytic way to derive an expression for it at a given distance.

To do so, you need integrate F dot dr from r to infinity. However, what I don't understand are as follows:

- Why do we need to take the zero point at r = infinity? Why can't I take it from any arbitrary point to get a general expression for its GPE when I integrate?

- Why is the work required to push an object to that height equal to the force due to gravity times the distance? Don't I need to apply a force that overcomes the force due to gravity to even raise it to begin with? Fg * h is definitely greater in magnitude than fg, but if I'm applying work to an object equal to Fg * h in the *opposite* direction of where it wants to move (towards the dominant object's COM) how do I know the magnitude of that work is sufficient to do so? 

If I was trying to figure out how much energy I need to give an object to raise it from one point in space to another relative to, say the Earth, I could take the change in energy from the two points. If its energy at its initial point is 2 and the energy at the point I want it to be at is 8, I need to supply 6 joules to it. But how do I reconcile that with the derivation from the above paragraph?

2) The second question has to do with zero points for potential energy. Is this allowed because, as long as the distance from each object relative to another is the same no matter where I place a zero point, everything resolves? If at point A, object 1 is 2 units from point A and object 2 is 5 units from point A (all in, say, the x axis), then I'm not cheating by taking point B to be at object 1's position and saying object 2 is now 3 units from point B, right? Wouldn't its potential energy then change here though? That's okay because it's all relative, right? But the magnitude changes.. that's okay?

From what I've come to understand, the Coanda effect really doesn't apply because we're not dealing with a fluid jet. 

The explanation I've heard is that the curvature of an airfoil creates a centripetal acceleration, which creates a pressure gradient where lower pressure exists closer to the airfoil.

But there's some relationship I'm missing, because to me that seems dependent on a tendency to stay attached to the surface. As I understand it, in order for there to be centripetal force acting on the fluid, some additional force must be acting on it to keep the boundary flow attached. Otherwise, when the air diverts over the top of the wing, it would just continue unaccelerated past the upper camber of the airfoil. 

So what keeps the boundary flow ""attached"" to the airfoil? Is it something as simple as friction?

In the midst of an argument with an acquaintance about whether modern physics research supports various nebulous and semi-spiritual claims he was making about the connectedness of the universe, the power of the collective conscious to manifest things in reality, etc., he brought up the concept of quantum entanglement. He assured me that two quantum particles could become connected in such a way that even if one was subsequently moved a great distance away, the two would continue to influence one another in experimentally measurable ways. The example he gave was ""like you could flip one's spin or something and the other particle would mirror that change from halfway across the world.""

I told him laypeople like us often misunderstand the significance and real meaning of high-level research like he was describing and that I was SURE what he described is not how matter actually behaves. In fact, I told him if he could produce a reputable scholarly research article where that phenomenon had been observed, I would pay him $100.

He first tried to send me the Wikipedia page about quantum entanglement, and when I rejected that, he sent a link to [this article](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.017903) that admittedly goes over my head.

So...do I owe him the money? If what he's claiming is true and changes to a particle in Chicago could influence the behavior of a particle in Paris, it will sort of revolutionize the way I see matter and our universe. I still won't accept the majority of his lofty claims, but this one *would* blow my mind.

seppukuzushi,1492956766,672eud,"I've lost the link now, but this question came to mind after seeing a picture where it's demonstrated by diffracting light through a slit that florescent bulbs have discrete spectral emissions whereas incandescent bulbs have continuous spectral emissions.

I believe I understand -- to my satisfaction -- the mechanisms of florescence and LEDs and how they are different in practice, but I'll summarize in case that understanding needs correction. My question concerning incandescence is below.

\[recap\] 

Florescence is where electrons bound to an atom are excited by photon collisions and absorb energy sufficient to cause transition to a higher orbital. (I'm not sure if something like ""neon"" signs are florescent since they're excited electrically or if that's some more general process.) When they return to ground state, they release that energy as another photon of equal or lesser wavelength, i.e. energy, than that of the incident source photon, and that energy is directly determined by the energy difference of the orbitals, and so results in the discrete spectral lines.

LEDs provide a source voltage between a doped anode and cathode that supplies the electrons in the metals with enough energy to tunnel across the gap between the nodes. The energy required to jump said gap directly determines the energy of the emitted photon and similarly results in a discrete spectral profile.

If any if this is somewhere faulty, please correct me.

\[\\recap\]

With incandescent sources of light -- from what I can gather -- the heat from an arbitrary source, electrically induced in this case, is the kinetic energy of particles within a solid, and higher energy means they move and oscillate more strongly.

So... Since their components have charge, their movent through the electromagnetic field causes EM radiation?

And because that movement is not confined to discrete ranges, the emissions aren't either? Also, is this some somehow a phononic phenomenon? If ""phononic"" is a word. Where do the photons come from?

I suppose I just need a clarification of what exactly is happening. My brain is not quite wrapped around it.

How did those planes deal with that? Did they had a small offset on the ailerons to always create a tiny roll torque to counter the torque induced by the extra motor? And as a follow up question, can I calculate this torque based on the rotational speed and radius of propeller? Forgive me if I said anything wrong, Im an EE student, so aerospace engineering is still a bit new to me.

&gt;To me it sounds like a phenomenon related to negative temperature. By applying those lasers, the atoms were confined, which also bounded the energy upwards, and at the same time excited by those lasers. When you pump in more energy than it takes for maximum entropy state, the whole system starts behaving as a negative-temperature system – microstates with higher energy are favoured, as the total energy is too high anyway.
Apply a force – a potential field, and atoms will flow towards higher energy states – towards the direction the force was applied from.

Wasn't sure exactly how to phrase the title, and hopefully this is the right sub.

Many swimming pools have those nozzles in the side walls that shoot out a constant stream of water, often quite powerfully. Of course, if I place my hand in front of such a nozzle, my hand is pushed away. However, I've noticed that if I get my hand close enough to the nozzle (within a centimeter or so), the force pushing my hand away suddenly decreases. The flow also seems to transition from turbulent to more or less laminar (not sure if that's the right term). Hopefully my lovely MS Paint drawing helps demonstrate the phenomenon.

I've also found that this occurs when blowing on a piece of paper. If the paper is several inches away, the force is as you'd expect. But if you move the paper very close to your lips, it almost seems to 'stick' to your lips with relative ease, even while blowing with the same strength.

I'm sure this phenomenon is well known, I'm just curious what it is and why it occurs. I have a couple guesses... The first is that it has to do with the direction of flow. When the object in question is far away from the nozzle, the fluid gains a velocity in a direction perpendicular to the object, and the object forces the fluid to significantly change velocity, thus a force is imposed upon the fluid and the object. When the object is closer to the nozzle, the fluid never gains that velocity perpendicular to the object in the first place (but that doesn't make much sense, because it's still flowing perpendicular to the object before it exits the nozzle).

My other guess is that it relates to Bernoulli's principle. Specifically, once the object is close enough to the nozzle, the fluid is forced to accelerate to a high enough speed (travelling along the object's surface) that Bernoulli's principle lowers the pressure of the fluid a fair amount.

The second one seems to make much more sense to me.",askscience,Fluid dynamics question -- Why does a water nozzle repel with less force as I move an object closer to it?

diversification,1492482245,6604go,"Reading up on sunglasses is confusing as heck, especially for anyone hoping to save a bit of money. There's a lot of science here, and I'm having a lot of trouble finding a proper comprehensive rundown of everything that's involved, and what it all winds up meaning for consumers.

First you need to decide wether you want CR-39, Polycarbonate, Trivex, or Glass lenses. Does it even matter? Well, it might. If you're buying cheap and the glasses don't come with much (or any) reliable info, at least you'll know they're relatively UV resistant if they're Polycarbonate or Trivex, because that's a natural quality of those two solutions. Even still, they're not naturally UV400 compliant, so additional treatment/layers/coatings are needed to achieve that. Speaking of which, what the heck is UV400 and how does it differ from the other standards? Which is best? How much does it matter if you get a pair of sunglasses that doesn't explicitly comply. Are there various levels of compliance?

What about how UV and Polarization are even achieved? There are different methods, but what are they, and which are the most effective/desirable? Again, how much does it really matter? I know if it's a coating that easily wears off, that's bad, but how common is that? I've read that some Polarization is incorporated right into the lens itself, some are layered into the middle of the lense between sheets of glass, and some are just a film that's applied to the outside. What are the differences? There's no Polarization standard as far as I know, so how do you know what you're getting? Which is best?

I've heard lens clarity and uniformity can be a big deal, but aren't always easily perceptible. I've heard ones with lower clarity/uniformity can stress eyes and eventually cause notable eye problems. Is that accurate? How does one identify good lenses in this regard?

Now, I know abstractly that allowing gases to expand causes them to cool. It even sort of makes sense, if you define heat as the average energy of particles in a region. 

However, why is the gas able to effectively cool other objects whose density isn't changing? The gas molecules don't suddenly know they're being released from confinement, they continuing bouncing around just like they always have. The only change--as I understand it--is that now that bouncing is statistically biased to happen in a certain directly, namely, out of the spigot. 

While the gas may be cooling, it's also becoming less dense, which should reduce its ability to transmit heat, right? 

Taken to the extreme, let's say the spigot was immersed in a box of highly compressed propane, and that box was in space. Suddenly, the box just vanishes. All the propane molecules keep bouncing around as they were before, only now those that are heading to the outside of the box don't come back, and the propane spigot is surrounded by a rapidly expanding cloud of propane gas.

infernotongue,1492354075,65pga1,"I've read about how people, after a complete corpus callosotomy, can continue performing tasks requiring coordinated action from their right and left sides, e.g. running. Yet, if the brain hemispheres can not communicate directly, then in such cases, how does the coordination, or even the initiation of a gross action occur? Could it be like this:

Let's say there is a stimulus to run, e.g. a dinosaur comes chasing and both hemisphere fire, yet whichever side gets going first, the other side starts complementing it with a response that will keep the body balanced and running. E.g. If one side speeds up, the other either agrees and speeds up accordingly, or maybe it quarrels. But both sides know that it is in their interest to escape the velociraptor.  

Essentially, I'd guess that the hemispheres' coordination is via the feedback that they receive from the already effectuated actions of their other half. Maybe this occurs on a subconscious level for both sides? Anyways, if true, I can't understand how it doesn't lead to massive problems, e.g. you see your Ex and one side want's to interact and the other wants to walk off.

So today a friend asked me about the nuclear fusion inside the sun, and I gave the explanation that it occurs in the sun's core due to the sheer pressure within itself that allows the helium atoms to overcome the coulomb force and fuse together into helium.

So is my answer widely false or just inaccurate? Is there just a correlation between the sun's mass and quantum tunneling (i.e. lots of protons necessary for quantum tunneling having the effect you can observe every day = lots of protons to make up all that mass) or is there a bit of causation as well (i.e. the mass is helping quantum tunneling to Some extent)?

luigitrash,1492162924,65bmlv,"Apparently some say it occurs at the event horizon, others say much further away. I would've thought it's close to the ""surface"" of the mass. 
So let me start here. I assume that a black hole is a spherical piece of mass such as a neutron star, just denser, and massive enough to ""capture"" light as well as creating a no light zone around it. The more massive a black hole, the bigger this zone is. The more massive a black hole (bh), the less hawking radiation (hr).
Now my problem: If hr occurs at the event horizon, the virtual particle escaping it would need to travel close to the speed of light but would be a lot of energy for a random occurence with very little energy (?). 
If it occurs millions of km away and the escaping particle just barely hits just the distance from the bh where it's velocity would allow it to not instantly get dragged back, wouldnt it just go into orbit around the bh and then not be hr? (I realize we don't really know too much about virtual particle's interaction with gravity, or do we?)
Now the only logical way for hr to work for me is this; hr only occurs directly on the surface of the piece of mass. (not the event horizon) Virtual particles are not affected by gravity in any way. The virtual particle annihilating in the bh just happend to travel right into the surface when it was created while the other one just happend not to, because it went the other way and continues to do so beacause it's counter part found another counter part in the bh. In my theory black hole's surfaces are smaller, the more massive they are, because they attrack it's own mass more and don't care about density limitations. Meaning the less massive a bh, the more surface, the more likely one of these hr processes becomes, thus increasing hr effectively. This would explain exactly why more massive black holes have less hr and not more.

It raises the question (not begs the question people) of why Vivotrol is not a weapons-grade torture drug (that would be scary!).


I've asked professors this and they don't seem to have a clue. One told me he believes opioid agonists, antagonists, and endorphins bind at the same site on the mu-opioid receptor, but he didn't seem too sure, so feel free to correct.


Now I have one small clue as to the answer. In my understanding (again feel free to correct) whether an agonist or an antagonist overpowers the other is mostly due to binding affinity, to a lesser extent intrinsic activity. I imagine some nebulous steric property of receptor proteins may also be at play. I gather that these two properties are also important in determining potency. Anyway, [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC430793/) it claims that beta-endorphin has at least 18x the analgesic potency of morphine. It *also* claims that it is blocked by naloxone. Interesting to say the least.
If beta-endorphin has a potency closer to some of the weaker fentanyl analogues than it goes to say that perhaps only a *large dose* of naloxone can reverse it's effects, much like fentanyl, and that perhaps a standard dose of naltrexone cannot.


This brings us to one answer I've heard before (and at least needs more explaining): ""Well, if you aren't *in pain* then you don't need endorphins"" or something to that effect. This answer seems a little naive. From what I understand most transmitters/hormones etc are found in fluctuating amounts in the body but **are not** either there or totally absent. Yes I know how action potentials work, no I don't mean that.


Since your body is constantly being damaged and being repaired to some extent, as well as the fact that pain in the absence of corresponding stimuli is a thing, I'd assume that pain, perhaps of a potentially debilitating degree, is constantly suppressed by your nervous system. Thus it would seem reasonable that endorphins and the like are there, on the macroscopic scale, at all times to some degree.


I understand directly supporting an answer may be difficult. A sound argument perhaps with circumstantial evidence would do in that case.


**Bonus Questions**


Is it likely possible that a drug capable of ""causing opiate withdrawal in normal people"" could be developed? 


If so how would it differ from current opioid antagonists?


What about the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (I'd imagine not)? Other GABA-blockers?

TheRealDonnyDrumpf,1491753767,64drmc,"I have a decent understanding of the standard model, but not the complex math behind it. I was great at calculus in high school, and took linear algebra in college, though I didnt enjoy matrices (which unfortunately seem very important here). During some reading, without being able to fully grasp the math (SU(2) matricies?), it seems like there are some important implications being made by the math of the electroweak theory and the higgs mechanism. Apologies in advance for length of the post and the number of questions, but there seems to be so many related facets. Ill try to sum up my questions at the end. 

So at every day energies we have three separate forces explained by the standard model. The electromagnetic force, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. At everyday energies, the electromagnetic force is mediated by photons, and the weak force is mediated by W^+, w^-, and Z^0 bosons. 

From my understanding:

The electromagnetic force and the weak force are, at very high energies, the same thing; the interactions of both forces exchange photons. In this environment, all elementary particles are massless. The higgs field becomes unstable (wikipedia refers to a ""tachyonic system"" that has an imaginary component to its mass?) and electroweak symmetry breaking occurs. This symmetry breaking results in three of the four ""degrees of freedom"" of the higgs field manifesting themselves by giving mass to the three bosons of the weak force, and the fourth becomes a new particle called the Higgs Boson (condensation?). All particles that we know to have mass acquire it at this time.

To me, it seems like that question inevitable crosses paths with the concept of gravity. If mass came into existence at that moment, wouldnt gravity, being attraction between two masses, by definition have to have come into existence at the same time?

Similarly, it seems like it's related to special relativity as well. From my understanding of special relativity, its main conclusion is that all objects move through space-time at the same rate; and the various Lorentz transformations for mass, length, and time exist to preserve this universal speed limit. Unless my understanding is flawed, to a stationary observer, a stationary object is moving entirely through time, while an object moving at the speed of light is moving entire through space. Then, wouldnt the moment of electroweak symmetry breaking, and the first introduction of mass to the universe be first time anything moved below the speed of light? 

Lastly, its said the the 4 ""degrees of freedom"" of the higgs field manifested themselves as massive W/Z bosons and the higgs boson. To me, degrees of freedom seems to imply quite literal extra dimensions. But, not extra dimensions as we know them. Instead, dimensions that (much to my confusion) seem to be contained, or represented, by the spin of the bosons of the weak force; or even possibly by thinking of mass itself as a ""dimension"", or more accurately a ""degree of freedom"". Do these ""degrees of freedom"" have any involvement in the ""extra dimensions"" of string theory and other attempts at GUT's or TEO's?

The best way I can explain it to myself is that the earlier universe had more ""degrees of freedom"" than the universe today, and those could possibly be referred to as extra dimensions. Instability in the universe itself resulted in the ""condensation"" of four of those degrees of freedom into four bosons, the W/Z and Higgs Bosons. At that moment all particles in the standard model, aside from the photon and the gluon, acquire mass. The acquisition of mass also seems to be involved, by definition, with the creation of gravity and spacetime itself. 

Given the summary of my understanding, I have a ton of questions. I dont expect easy to understand answers to all of them, or to leave here an expert. If I leave here understanding anything at all just a little better, thats awesome. I understand that a lot of these questions dont have concrete answers yet, but any input is appreciated. I'm sure many people could help me understand some things and not others; and I'm also sure many of my questions are closely related.

1. Is there any intuitive way to understand why this early universe was unstable, and what exactly an ""imaginary mass"" is? 

2. Is there any more intuitive way to understand this ""condensation""? 

3. What did these ""degrees of freedom"" represent prior to symmetry breaking, and how do they correspond to modern spin and mass? It seems that mass could be defined as another dimension, in a mathematical sense. Is that accurate at all? And are the other three ""degrees of freedom"" in any sense extra mathematical dimensions, possibly that explain the counter-intuitive nature of quantum spin? Is movement through an unperceived dimension the reason particles ""spin"", but not in a classical way through our 3 spatial dimensions.

4. Do any of these ""degrees of freedom"" relate to the higher dimensions in String Theory?

5. If the 4 degrees of freedom of the higgs field broke into these 4 bosons, why does the higgs field still exist? And not only exist, why does it appear that this moment where the higgs field breaks is the moment it really becomes what we know as the higgs field: what gives everything mass. 

6. Isnt this tied to the structure of space-time on a fundamental level? Non-movement, and movement at the speed of light, both seem to be opposing absolutes in a universe where movement through space and movement through time always complementary sum to the universal speed limit. In a universe where everything moves at the speed of light, wouldnt relativity imply that everything would appear to move at the speed of light relative to everything else? Which, again according to special relativity, everything would observe everything else as having stopped in time. Wouldnt this mean that the creation of time itself, or at least the first time that this dimension was ever utilized from the perspective of anything else, was at the moment of electroweak symmetry breaking? Does this represent a fundamental change in the structure of space-time itself?

7. Isnt this moment, as the moment mass is first created, also the moment gravity must have first arisen? Or, per E=mc^2, did gravity most likely act on the energy of the system as if it were mass? 

8. Given questions 6 and 7, and if my understanding is not severely flawed, is there any leading explanation for this phenomena that involves the nexus of mass creation, the structure of spacetime, and the origins of gravity?

So from that point of view, hydrostatic equilibrium of earth will be this disc shape. Electric forces that push atoms apart and gravitational forces that push them together are still balancing each other out, just that this balance now causes earth to be in a very weird shape.

atlantictopacific,1491574283,640m3p,"I had a thought about dark energy, and I wondered if it was possible.  I think the second law of thermodynamics (""In any cyclic process the entropy will either increase or remain the same."") might run into the law of conservation of energy in an astronomical sense.  When I think about star systems slowing expending their energy out into the void, every drop of that energy must be being transferred somewhere else in the system.  If dark energy is an expansionary force, could it be driven by the amount of electromagnetic energy that is passing through any particular point in space?  This idea would have a couple of testable consequences.  First, the dark, quiet, low energy points in the universe should have the lowest amount of dark energy.  Conversely, high energy locations (e.g., a point close to the center of the Milky Way) that is highly traveled by radiation should have a higher amount of dark energy.  2) Because we know that electromagnetic radiation can travel incredibly long distances intact (e.g., light from other galaxies reaching our own), the impact of radiation transferring energy from itself to the points that it travels through must be incredibly small.  Nonetheless, radiation that has traveled very long distances should be different (and hopefully measurably different) from radiation that has traveled a short distance.

Embarrassing admittance, I actually have an undergrad degree in physics; apparently I didn't pay enough attention in E&amp;amp;amp;amp;M.  I can't come up with a way to assign this a specific question as I feel there is something fundamental I am missing.  Anyway, I digress, on to the explanation.    
    
I have two DC power supplies both wired into the same AC line that produce 24v.  [Here is an image of my horrible wiring](https://i.imgur.com/VYXFvHp.png).  I imagine that the  circuit diagram [probably looks like something along these lines](https://i.imgur.com/BD4A8OG.png) (I am aware this is grossly simplified and incorrect, not the point).    
    
I was playing around and attempted to wire a light from the - side of one power supply to the positive side of another.  The light didn't light and I found this confusing.  So I broke out my volt meter and measured the potential difference between the positive side of one power supply to the negative side of the other.  [This is what I saw](https://i.imgur.com/K3mrUrs.png). 
 What?    
    
I found this extremely confusing and I'll explain why shortly.  I randomly cranked up the sensitivity of my volt meter and took the measurement again.  [This time I did measure a potential](https://i.imgur.com/WVX62G3.png).  That's millivolts, which I have no explanation for.  Even more unusual was that this oscillated between +- 40 millivolts.  What the heck?  Why is this oscillating, I thought this was DC?    
    
Like a good little scientist I decided to just measure every possible combination of connections between the two devices producing [this table](https://i.imgur.com/GemUMBT.png) that just leaves me confused.  (Note these are maximum potentials as they all oscillate for some reason).    
    
My understanding of things was that both of these power supplies generated a potential relative to ground (grounds are tied BTW).  All the happy little electrons pooled at the negative DC terminal ready to travel off to a potential difference.  Before doing this little experiment, I would have assumed that there would be a current flow from the negative of one power supply to either the positive OR the ground of the other.  There isn't.  Apparently my understanding of the physics here is extremely flawed.  What the heck is going on?    
    
My horrific list of questions I don't know how to answer: Why do I measure almost zero potential difference between the two power supplies?  Why does it oscillated on a DC system?  Why am I measuring a potential difference between the two positives or the two negatives?  Why is that potential difference the same magnitude as the potential difference I measure between - and positive?  Why do I measure a potential difference between BOTH positive and ground AND negative and ground?    
    
This has been bothering me for about a week and I have discussed it at length with two electrical engineers neither of which could give me a good explanation.  So thanks for putting up with my rant and thanks for the help ahead of time :)    
    
Note: This could probably be classified just as easily as an engineering question and it may have an engineering answer that I am not aware of, but I feel it's important to note that it's the physics I am particularly interested in.

Mainly I don't really understand how radio waves work. I presented several question here, in order for you to help me understand, but the big question is ""**how do radio waves work?**""

Let's start with location - PC1 (the black one) receives data from the router (the red one). This can also apply to FM radio. If I move my laptop, I still receive the same data, so there are waves of information everywhere - but each second it transmits different data, meaning that near the transmitting station, there is a different data that the one that had to travel all the way to the other end of the room/house/street. So why moving the receiver doesn't disrupt the signal?

Now look at the blue waves - they hit the wall and get back to the receiver ( waves do get projected from walls right? Well I don't know about wifi, but there are different types of waves right? ) so the receiver gets at least 2 different signal at any given time. Shouldn't it also disrupt the signal? If we talk about a wifi for a second - in every part of the room there are different set of ""1""s and ""0""s, and it received ""1""s and ""0""s simultaneously from all the wall projections.

Additional info: I was radio specialist in the army in my country, was AP physics in high school and currently doing computer science major. So I do now understand that specific topic, but I do have some background if you don't want to ELI5.

On the flip side, the falling astronaut would see time accelerate for everything outside the influence of the black hole's gravitational field. They would experience local time normally and would pass through the event horizon as expected, but only after watching the entire universe experience time faster and faster and faster. If this is the case, how does anything fall through the event horizon in a finite amount of time?  My first thought was that the black hole might still absorb energy via electromagnetic radiation.

So what on earth is going on??


EDIT: Thanks everyone for some brilliant responses. It seems to me there are really two parts of this answer:

1) The higher energy states for the particle are simply the only ones ""left over"" in that same position of two electrons tried to occupy the same space. It's a statistical thing, not an actual force. Comments to this effect have helped me ""grok"" this at last.

By the way this one gives me new appreciation for why for example matter starts heating up once gravity has brought it closer together in planet formation / stars / etc. Which is quit interesting.

2) The spin-statistics theorem is the more fundamental ""reason"" the pauli exclusion principle gets observed. So I guess thats my next thing to read up on and try to understand.

context: never studied physics explicitly as a subject, but studied chemistry to a reasonably high level. I like searching for deeper reasons behind why things happen in my subject, and of course it's all down to physics. Like this, it usually turns out to be really interesing.

Personally, I'm an atheist, and I don't doubt the veracity of carbon dating (I find it hard to believe this many scientists would not have considered this ""problem"").

Porkfolio,1489913998,6098kc,"I’ve been wrestling with the idea of randomness a seemingly deterministic universe, and I’ve realized that I’m not entirely sure how to rigorously define what randomness is. To be clear, I’m talking about true, ontological randomness, not the weaker epistemological version (“for all we can ever know, it may as well be random”). Many definitions I’ve read seem to conflate two subtly different ideas: 


1)	An event is random iff it was **not initiated** by a cause; that is, iff it is **not an effect** of another event (visualize a billiard ball “randomly” shooting forward on its own). I've heard quantum mechanics described as ""acausal,"" which seemed to be used interchangably with the idea of randomness. 


2)	An event is random iff its **outcome is probabilistic** at best, and not deterministic; that is, iff its result cannot, even in theory, be perfectly accurately predicted given all possible information and computing power (visualize a billiard ball being struck by another, and being jolted into a “random” trajectory such that, even flawlessly recreating the initial conditions, it could have taken a different path). 


A possible third one seems a little over-restrictive to me, but I’ll include it for completeness, because it seems to be common: 


3)	An event is random iff **all outcomes are equally likely**. It seems to me that this definition is a more restrictive version of (2), leaving out non-uniform probability distributions. 


I’m also not sure that 1 and 2 are **not** logically equivalent. (Might a probabilistic outcome require an uninitiated event to have occurred at some point in its causal chain? And conversely, wouldn’t an uninitiated event be inherently uncertain?) Or, if not quite equivalent, how might they be related? 


Note: I realize it isn’t universally agreed on that true randomness exists at all. It’s a super interesting topic which I see discussed a lot here—which is what’s prompting me to ask what, precisely, it is.

bremby,1489615006,5zmhw7,"I don't know the right terminology so please let me explain.

In car and airplane aerodynamics, engineers have to consider not only aerodynamics on the front-facing side of the vehicle, but also on the back side. The idea is to reduce turbulence and low pressure, which has the effect of ""pulling the vehicle back"". I imagine this by having a moving object creating a vacuum (low pressure) behind itself, which ""sucks in"" everything around, including the object itself. Better shapes of the object will allow more air to fill out the vacuum (low pressure) area quicker, which will induce lower ""pulling"" force on the object.

Now the question is, what about rockets? If you look on [this picture of the tail of Saturn V](http://www.collectspace.com/images/news-061616b-lg.jpg), it clearly shows how the rocket body is simply ""cut off"", or flat, and then the engine nozzles stick out. In my mind such moving body has to create lots of low-pressure-pulling force in the area between the flat rocket bottom and the tips of the nozzles, especially at high speeds.

Now obviously it cannot be perfectly aerodynamic as we may need some nozzle gimballing, or have the incoming air cool the nozzles down a bit, or simply vibrations prevent us covering up the engines/nozzles. But such a flat surface simply looks like a beginner's first attempt at rocket design (no offence :) ).

Or is that simply ignored due to short time spent in the dense part of the atmosphere?

EDIT: Because there's some confusion, I made a [picture](http://imgur.com/a/6msTW) to explain. I am specifically talking about the area between the flat **rocket body** and the end of the nozzle. The red arrows on the picture depict turbulent air. The other rocket design does not suffer from this as there is no such empty space. Just look at the Saturn V tail as I linked before, it has the first design from my picture. I hope it's clear now. Also bear in mind I understand it is not always possible to engineer the second design, I mentioned that above, but it should be possible to do something in-between those two.",askscience,Do rockets suffer from aerodynamic drag caused by truncated tail?

Ok, so that makes sense to me. You can then add on the idea that if either *a* or *b* is negative, you just do all of this stuff and then take the reciprocal. And so:

* 2.5^-5/2, or 2.5^-2.5, means 2.5 * 2.5 * 2.5 * 2.5 * 2.5 = 97.65625, and then you take the square root of that, which is ~9.882117, and then you take the reciprocal of that, which is ~0.101192

In order to do this, both *a* and *b* must be positive integers, because its an iterative process - you can't multiply something by itself 2/3s of a time. But usually you'll be able to express *a/b* in the form of positive integers.

What doesn't make sense to me is that you can somehow take numbers to the power of things which are not rational (e.g. *a/b* can't be expressed as a ratio of positive integers) and therefore can't follow this step by step process. I guess there's two different categories here, which are:

* Exponents which are real but irrational (either transcendental or not). So, for example, how can you take *n*^π or *n*^*e*? In these cases, the exponent can't be expressed as a fraction, and so you can't really do the two step process of taking *n*, multiplying it by itself *a-1* times, and then taking the *b*th root. We can get rough estimates, I suppose (for example, you can use 22/7 or other similar fractions for π), but is that how we actually do this? Or is there some other conceptual way to think about exponents which permit irrational exponents?

* Exponents which are complex numbers. This is really why I started to think about this entire question, as I was doing some (very basic) learning about the Reimann Zeta function (which I posted about here yesterday and got awesome responses about). That function requires taking numbers to the power of a + b**i**. And I just don't even know what that means. I know I can type it into google and an answer will spit out, but it just doesn't make conceptual sense to me based on my understanding of what an exponent is.

Any insight would be awesome. Thanks!

Therefore the energy of a particular photon is a *continuous random variable* whose probability distribution is proportional to the spectrum of a black body at 5700°K.

What's the probability that a continuous random variable takes the value of a particular number? IIRC from statistics, this probability is **zero**. By this logic the photon should *never* be absorbed. You only get a non-zero probability when you reason about a non-zero-width range.

DisinterestingStory,1489264127,5yupqh,"My intuition would be that light responds to boundary conditions instantly. How else would light know to almost completely pass through glass (~96%) in the incident direction and not scatter much at all to the sides? My ridiculous explanation for this is that, to a photon, all of space is a single point at any given point in time, so its entire path is known, and therefore to truly solve for the fields, the boundary conditions at every point in the photon's path must be used. Yes, I am aware that it does not make much sense to use a photon as our frame of reference which I why I call this ridiculous.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Now, it is my understanding that the modes within a waveguide take some nonzero time to establish. This would seem to imply that the photons do not know their boundary conditions at every point in space ahead of time (or something). This seems to undermine my above reasoning.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So here are some additional theoretical questions:
If we take a multimode fiber and splice in a singlemode fiber, after say, two meters, my assumption (and current understanding) is that only the fundamental mode will exist at any point in the fiber. Again, my explanation is that the photons somehow know that they cannot establish those other modes because they know about that singlemode section of fiber that is coming up. Is this the case? This is obviously assuming that the incident light has a high enough frequency to support multiple modes.  
&amp;nbsp;  
What if we have a long section (200m) of multimode fiber then a one meter section of singlemode fiber then another 200m of multimode fiber all spliced together? Will multiple modes exist in the first section of the fiber? I assume only one mode will exist in the singlemode section. If multiple modes exist in the first section of the fiber, will multiple modes restablish themselves in the second section of multimode fiber? If these modes were transmitting different signals, will the signals be able to be recovered in the second section of multimode fiber or will they all be mixed? If multiple modes exist at any point in this spliced fiber, it again undermines my current understanding.

* As it approaches the event horizon, the lightsource emits light - some (less and less) reaches me.
* The moment the lightsource passes the Event Horizon, even the light that should be heading directly away from the singularity will have insufficient speed to escape. If its direction is straight away from the singularity, its speed is c, and its point of origin is exactely at the Event Horizon - this light should ""stand still"" (?)
* I wait for the black hole to shrink due to Hawking Radiation (in the meantime I play intergalactic garbageman and prevent any matter/energy from falling into the black hole)
* The shrunken black hole has less mass and a smaller Event Horizon, meaning that light trapped at the former Event Horizon (e.g. some of the light from the lightsource I trew in) CAN now escape.
* (Which in turn would futher reduce the mass of the black hole?)

It's electron configuration is 2s2 2p3 , which means 2s is filled, and all three 2px, 2py, 2pz can form covalent Pauli pair bonds. The heuristic I learned for understanding why carbon (and those in its group) has valence 4, is because even though its electron configuration is 2s2 2p2 (so it would have a valence of 2), the difference in E between the 2s and 2p levels is so small that the bonding E more than offsets the E required to shift an electron from the 2s to the 2p, so that effectively the configuration is 2s1 2p3 , in which case it clearly has a valence of 4. This heuristic doesn't work anymore for nitrogen, because 2s1 2p4 can't covalently bond 5 electrons, since one of the 2s or 2p states has to be completely filled, whether 2s or 2px or 2py or 2pz. Further, I don't see how it could be energetically favorable to promote one of the 2s or 2p electrons up to the 3s level, which is a much larger jump such that if it were allowed then the valency of all the other elements would be thrown off.

Paul-Lubanski,1489033183,5yczqh,"I'm interested in infinite dimensional vector spaces as I am trying to learn formal Quantum Mechanics. As I understand it, the Hilbert Space associated with a degree of freedom corresponding to movement along a certain axis is L^2 (R), that is the equivalence classes of lebesgue-integrable functions on the real line whose integral is the same. I understand that the use of continuous (or even differentiable) functions to describe states is possible without anything going wrong as the subspace of infinitely differentiable functions of compact support (C) is dense in L^2 (R). So I guess that L^2 is the completion of  C. My questions are:

I know that in infinite dimensional vector spaces it is important to distinguish between the algebraic dual (the set of all linear functionals) and the topological dual (consisting only of the continuous ones). Also, L^2 is *similar* to its topological dual via the Reiz representation theorem (I write similar because I think that the relationship between the spaces provided by such theorem is an antilinear transformation and I do not know if there is a regular isomorphism between both spaces). How is the topological dual embedded in the algebraic one (is it in any way in particular)? 

The question arose because even if there are no free particle eigenstates in L^2 (that is, for those who ignore QM, eigenstates of the laplacian operator), plane waves DO fullfill this requirement, and the later being connected (in some way I don't quite understand formally yet) via the Fourier transform to the delta functions, themselves being in the algebraic dual of C.

edit: 

Hello everyone, I appreciate all the feedback received from this post and I'm grateful for such well presented answers. I realise that this sort of question can raise many different answers due to the question being too general. 

But as I understand from most of the replies... The reason the light from those stars will never entirely vanish is because even when the star/galaxy passes the cosmological event horizon, the space between us and them is only expanding and so the light that was sent before the star/galaxy passing the cosmological event horizon will only stretch due to the expansion and continue to reach us but through other spectrums of light as it continues to redshift. Would this be correct? 

I would also like to bring forward a question that has been brought up by a few other redditors. However as it may seem there is no exact answer to it, I'd like to ask a question similar to it:

Which stars/galaxies have most noticeably redshifted or faded from visual light? I'd definitely like to read up on this topic so any names or articles would be great.

Being a total stranger about radiation (not to mention the need of reviewing that I need to do to refresh my basic chemistry skills), as the title states, does radiation stop once an element is fully decayed?

So far, in general, in terms of radiation of elements, each has a half life wherein elements slowly decay. As an element decays, it gives out an ionizing radiation. 

Finally, I want to make sure that I am understanding the general concept of radiation correctly: 

Ionizing radiation comes in different forms (alpha, beta, and gamma). Alpha is less likely to cause harm to our body as their waves cannot really make it past our skin's dead skin cell. Beta radiation, on the other hand, can be blocked by our clothes and therefore a regular lab coat would be sufficient to act as protection. Finally, Gamma radiation is the meanest of them all as it can travel really far and a person needs to be fully geared by lead shields in order to be safe. Is this correct?

*EDIT: Also, I found out that, when swallowed/inhaled, Alpha radiation can cause severe damage (even death). If that is the case, how come we are not being poisoned by the potassium in our body or whenever we eat bananas

A 3 MW wind turbine tower (ca. 5.000.000 kWh / year) is 100 m tall and about 5 m wide.

So only 1% - 2% solar in comparison to wind.


**Pros**

* no extra land needed
* very little shadows on the panels

* electrical installations are mostly (?) already in place

* low installation cost, as the towers are produced en masse and in factorys

* slightly higher grid stability (when the wind blows and it's overcast / when the sky is clear and it's calm) (also solar should be able to produce at least more than the 1 - 2% of wind stated above, since thats per annum and in reality solar produces power only half of the day -&gt; 2 - 4% ?)

* maintenance difficulty due to hight 

* wind puts high stresses on panels ",askscience,Why aren't solar panels mounted on wind turbine towers?

From my viewpoint, vertical wires of the screen door are being magnified by the glass and I can easily see them and the dispersion of light around them.

Is this due to the curvature of the prisms? Is the mesh interacting with light and dispersing it before the light gets to the glass, where it is being dispersed further?

I'm not asking how light is observed or if planet A would observe planet B at 0.96c, i'm asking what is the physical location and velocity of the planets relative to each other.

&amp;nbsp;

**Premise 2:**
Now let's say we are on Planet D, and we will use Planet D as the stationary reference point. Planets A and B start right beside us, Then suddenly both Planets shoot off in opposite directions at 0.75c each.

1 Year of Time has passed and now Planet A is exactly 0.75 LightYears of Distance away from us (Planet D)... and also Planet B is 0.75 LightYears in the opposite direction. correct???
So now Planet A and B are exactly 1.5 LightYears apart after 1 Year of Time???

&amp;nbsp;

Now let's ignore Planet D and have a ride on planet A instead. After 1 Year of Time Planet B is now 1.5 LightYears away from us (Planet A), so surely that means Planet B was travelling at 1.5c relative to Planet A??? If they are 1.5 LightYears apart, then surely Planet B was truly travelling at a velocity of 1.5c relative to Planet A.... otherwise how would they be 1.5 LightYears apart.

So onto the title question again, if the Planets crashed into each other, then wouldn't Planet B impact Planet A at the true velocity of 1.5c and not 0.96c ??? Again I am not asking how Planet A observes the speed of light or observes Planet B. I am asking what the true velocity and physical location of the Planets are relative to each other. 

So if the answer is 0.96c, then doesn't that mean Premise 2 is incorrect and after 1 Year of time, A and B would be 0.96 Light years apart and not 1.5?

moschles,1488082291,5w8dnj,"Does electron capture have a bearing on the particulate nature of the electron, versus its wave description? 

Quantum Field Theory demands that we commit to an ontology of the electron as a local ripple in the electromagnetic field, above and beyond that field's vacuum state.   

Beryllium is known to decay via  a process of electron capture . (see http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Nuclear/radact2.html#c3 )  

The Compton Wavelength of the electron has a size that is roughly on the order of the distance between the nucleus of the beryllium atom and its first inner electron orbital.  This distance is between 0.90x10^-10 m and 1.05 x 10^-10 m . The radius of the nucleus, however is on the order of 10^-15 meters.  

 Imagine that we have committed to an ontology of the electron as synonymous with its Schroedinger Wave. Then we dispense with having to discuss the electron's ""actual location""  (as if it were also a localized particle or perhaps a point particle).  We may even go on to say something clever like :   ""the actual location has no physical meaning"".      In this situation, we expect that the wave-like nature of the electron denies it's ability to interact with features of the universe smaller than the deBroglie wavelength. 

But from peak-to-peak of that wave, the nucleus of beryllium is approximately a factor of 0.0000159  times smaller.   If electron capture physically happens (and it does happen) , and the nucleons are transformed into other particles as a result of this absorption,  can we justifiably deny any meaning to the electron having a more ""localized"" character beyond its Schroedinger Wave and a purely QFT framework?

georgelappies,1488016061,5w3e4q,"Hi all

Firstly I have a reasonable knowledge of physics and biology (at least college level for both, but not university level). I firmly believe in the Big Bang theory and evolution.

In a nutshell I believe the order of events with regards to life to be something like this:

1. Big Bang takes place.
2. Mostly hydrogen in the initial universe with some helium being formed.
3. Gravity causes hydrogen to form massive stars.
4. These massive stars forges carbon and oxygen and other heavier metals in their cores.
5. Stars explode and this star dust forms rocky planets around other newly formed stars created by the left over hydrogen from the heavier stars.
6. Enough time passes and the rocky planets cool down enough to form atmospheres. And if just far and close enough from its host star even liquid water could form.
7. In these early oceans hydrocarbon molecules leak into the water via vents.
8. These hydrocarbon molecules forms longer and longer chains.
9. Eventually RNA, DNA and proteins are formed.

All the above is still *easily explainable* by physics and chemistry.

Now what I don't get is what happened next to go from carbon based molecules to single cell organisms. 

Some of my questions are:

1. How did DNA know (at a chemical level) that it had to create a membrane around it?
2. How did the other much needed sub cellular components like the mitochondria know that it must be close enough to the core DNA of the cell to be included in a membrane?
3. For how long did single cell organisms form from forming a membrane around molecules? Is this still happening today? If not why not?
4. How did the first single cellular organism know (on a chemical level) that it was time to reproduce and split into two?
5. When did life go from simple chemical replication to complex cellular reproduction?

Say you have a pump pushing water out through a pipeline to another location 50 feet away. In the discharge side of this pump is an 8 inch pipe. There is a pressure gauge nearby on the 8 inch pipe that reads 50 PSI. This pipe continues down a bit and somewhere along the line is reduced from an 8 inch pipe to a 3 inch pipe or hose. Would the pressure on this smaller pipe/hose also be 50PSI, or would it be greater due to decreased surface area?

On one hand I feel like due it being Pounds per Square Inch, it wouldnt matter what place alone the line you gauged the pressure. On the other hand, I feel like it may increase in the smaller pipe due to larger sized force pushing into the reducer. I can not mentally figure this out lol.

The earths magnetic field runs north-south (or vice versa, I don't know), right? 
So, if you string up a long piece of wire in front of you spanning East-West, and dropped the wire parallel to the ground, will a voltage be produced on the ends of the conductor from the wire cutting through the earths magnetic field?

You could take 1 ball to B, go back to A, and do that 1000 times to complete the task. The time used here is 1000*(the time it needs to go from A to B, then A again).


Or you could take 1000 people that each takes 1 ball at a time, and make them go to B in the same time (as the movement of each person is independent of the others); here you are emphasizing the number of balls, so you'd need to take more people with you as the number of balls get bigger. The time here is just (the time it needs one person to go from A to B). With people same as number of balls, this task gets done more or less in a constant time. But gets bigger linearly as the distance goes up.


Or you could hire n people-where n is the distance from A to B- and make them do a chain, then pass one ball at a time to the first on the chain and make him pass it to the following person in the chain.

So let me give my understanding of a black hole and then I'll ask the things I'm confused about. And please also correct me where I'm wrong.  

My understanding is that a black hole is caused by any body that has been shrunk to a degree that has caused an enormous amount of density. This now exerts an enormous amount of gravitational force within a specific radius, so large that even light can't escape.
I believe this doesn't technically have to be an old star but practically speaking that's the only way it'd happen, for a star to die.  

Am I correct so far?  

Here's the questions I have:  

- What is the volume of a black hole? I've wondered this for years and never got a straight answer. When googling around I used to get math rather than a straight answer. My latest understanding was that the volume was zero and this is called the singularity. But just yesterday I read about a supermassive black hole in the phoenix cluster that seemed thousands of times larger than our solar system. I'm not referring to mass (though the mass was 20 billion times our sun) I'm referring to volume. Actually is volume technically the correct term?  

- What exactly is the Singularity, the Schwarzschild Radius, and the Event Horizon?  

My understanding of the Event Horizon is that it's the edge of space a specific radius from the hole where nothing can escape, not even light. Correct? But I also know that gravity is a function of mass. The sun's gravity doesn't affect astronauts in space because they have minimal mass but it affects pluto which is soooo much further away because pluto's mass is so much more. So if that's correct then while light may be able to escape from the edge of the event horizon, if you were to put, say, a paperclip a foot away from it that would probably get sucked in, right? If you were to put a human a mile behind the horizon I would guess that would also be sucked in. So it seems like the event horizon only measures what light can escape and is a fairly random thing outside of that. I dont see the relevance.  

EDIT - I just googled the Schwarzschild Radius. The explanation was simpler than I expected. But the explanation I'm seeing makes it sound like the definition of an Event Horizon to me

&gt;The Schwarzschild radius (sometimes historically referred to as the gravitational radius) is the radius of a sphere such that, if all the mass of an object were to be compressed within that sphere, the escape velocity from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light.",askscience,i have various questions about black holes?

I am the NOAA Fisheries National Entanglement Response Program Coordinator and I oversee NOAA’s whale entanglement response teams.  And I’m Ed Lyman, I serve as the large whale entanglement response coordinator for Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. 

Whales are becoming entangled in fishing gear and marine debris at an increasing rate and scientists are unsure why. Scar studies in U.S. waters show that 83 percent of all right whales and 70 percent of whales overall have been entangled in fishing gear or other marine debris at some point in their lives. Fortunately, the efforts of whale entanglement response teams are paying off. There are endangered North Atlantic right whales alive and reproducing today because of successful disentanglement efforts of NOAA Fisheries and our partners. 

Whale entanglement response teams must be available at a moment’s notice and they deal with a variety of cetacean species, from the largest to the smallest, in a range of different ocean and weather conditions. These teams are highly skilled and use specialized equipment to cut whales free from tangled lines, buoys, and other debris. They can also administer on-site medical care to treat wounds and promote continued recovery.

Lets say we had two super powerful electromagnets, situated a decent distance away from each other. One is on the right, and the other is on the left. They are situated so the magnetic fields would produce a repulsive force on one another. Both start in the OFF state.

To start the experiment, we briefly turn on the LEFT electromagnet and then quickly turn it off. Immediately as the left electromagnet is turning off, the one on the RIGHT is turning on.

Due to the fact that magnetic fields travel at the speed of light, it would be possible to set an appropriate distance and time this action so that the one on the left is OFF when it experiences the field from the electromagnet on the right... but the electromagnet on the right would be ON when experiencing the magnetic field from the left electromagnet.  This would occur since the electromagnet on the left was turned off before the one on the right was turned on, and the magnetic field from the left electromagnet was still in transit (at the speed of light) when the right electromagnet was turned on.

This should create a strong repulsive force on the right electromagnet, but not the left electromagnet. This force imbalance would create more momentum in the right electromagnet, which is obviously impossible.

So, a freind at school has been talking about e. Her older brother has remembered like 400 decimals of pi and he wanted her to remember e. But this got me thinking about e. I thought about a very typical limit for e. The limit of (1+1/n)^n as n approaches infinity. So i was wondering, how do we calculate e from this. I mean you cant actually make n infinently large. You could make n=10^50 and then n=10^100, keep going and you could kinda see what it approaches, but you can't know exacly, since n never reaches infinity, but we still know the exact decimals of e, how is that possible? I mean we can make a computer calculate, say 50 000 decimals of e, even though a computer can't make n reach infinity, but still if we had a more powerful computer, we could calculate 100 000 decimals of e. 

This has been bothering me for a while beacuse i've also heard that 1+1/2+1/3...=12. I've later checked that up and apparently it equals infinity. But still, how in the world do you calculate an infinite series, since you can't actually make something go on forever in practice, and neither in theory, beacuse any thinking entity that is in any way finite couldn't possibly comprehend something infinite. There shoudn't be any way to calculate something infinite since any formula that contains something infinte would require you to keep calculating forever without letting you ever reach the answer. I know that you can't write out e beacuse it's infinently long but it's not like 2,718 is the 3 first decimals of something very close the e, it's the 3 first decimals of e. We could write out every decimal of e if we had the time too, it's just that we don't and we never will, but we still know the exact value of e. How is this possible?

Just one more thing. A line, has infinently many points, which all have the same slope. But lets look at a curve. When you take the derivative of a curve at some point, how do you possibly calculate what it is, since a curve can potentially have a different slope at any 2 points next to eachother, and there are infinently many points on a curve. To take the derivative, it seems as if you would need to have infinte precision? It's seems as if though the whole of calculus is based around this infinite precision thing. Integrals use rectangles to approximate the area under a function right? And then you increase the numbers of rectangles all the way to infinity to get the exact area under the function, how do you do it?

Presumably, some of these collisions will send particles shooting off into space. 

Obviously, gravity plays a huge part in stopping escaping particles and pulling them back to Earth. However, in addition, I remember that when an object hits a certain speed (Earths escape velocity), its rate of deceleration from gravity is insufficient to stop it from traveling into space indefinitely. I assume gaseous particles travel fast enough to meet that requirement, at least some of the time.

As far as I know, there is no source that replenishes Earth's mass in the same way that the sun does for energy.

CuckedByJaredFogle,1486623580,5syjm9,"In an experiment called [Do Infants Possess an Evolved Spider-Detection Mechanism?](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6014324_Do_Infants_Possess_an_Evolved_Spider-Detection_Mechanism) scientists show rudimentary outlines of spiders to infants and track the infants's eyes to test if humans have an innate spider-detecting mechanism.  They show reconfigurations of the schematic spider image as well to see if the infants have a tendency to pay more attention to the original spider schematic than to the reconfigured ""random images.  


I was wondering why they had to go through the whole process of creating and using a schematic spider as opposed to just using pictures of actual spiders. At first I thought they only did this so that they could reconfigure the image, but then I realized they could easily do that with a picture of a real a spider. Later they used pictures of real spiders to prove that infants recognized the schematic spider as a spider, as opposed to seeing them as unrelated shapes.

ultradolp,1486619688,5syaj8,"Recently I read up a bit of Information Theory which talks about the concept of Entropy. However I am unable to find a satisfying answer that the logarithm of the event probability, i.e. log(1/p), is the optimal choice. Now I know that it has several attractive properties including:

* The joint information of two independent event is the sum of the individual information (i.e. H(A and B)=H(A)+H(B))

* The rarer the event, the more information content it has.

* If all outcomes are equally likely, then the entropy (which is defined on the self information) is maximized.

From the data compression/transmission standpoint, it makes sense to allocate less number of bit for frequent outcome but more for rare event. If that is the rationale behind self information, then what stops us from allocating even more to rare event, say move another 1 bit from the frequent event to rare event? I suppose it is related to some kind of lower bound on how many bit I have to allocate for any event.

Also, I was led to believe there is velocity coherence in masers, but in this case, how can a maser have a velocity width of 2200 km s^-1 ? Would not the molecules moving at different velocities result in collisions and dephasing throughout the masing region resulting in thermal equilibrium eventually? Even when looking at Figure 1, why does there appear to be two peaks as opposed to a single pulse as normally observed?

As I understand it (correct me if I am wrong), during the life cycle of early stars (the first generation after the Big Bang), as they burned through hydrogen and helium, their cores eventually became made of of large quantities of lead, making nuclear reactions impossible. The stars blow up, scattering their contents into space where that stuff is used in the formation of new stars, planets and all the other matter in the Universe.

That accounts for all of our elements up to lead on the periodic table. Is it correct that some of the heavier (from Lithium to lead) elements that become part of new (second generation and beyond) stars are ""fused"" in the nuclear reactions in the star into elements beyond lead?

Ashendal,1486252444,5s49sn,"I've been piecing together information based on an idea and I reached a stumbling point based on several videos and various written information on the topic. In them, the people explaining it seem to state that the Singularity and the Event Horizon of a Black Hole are separate in terms of what occurs in the normal lifetime of the object, but then they go on to it as a collective object and that the ""Black Hole"" itself evaporates overtime.

I've seen the evaporation described as the Event Horizon being a curved line with one particle on one side and another particle on the other, with one entering the Singularity and the other escaping as an X-ray or similar type of escaping ""object"" as the evaporation effect. Wouldn't that mean that the Singularity itself is still intact with all the matter it's collected over time in whatever location it's currently at, because while some particles are being expelled other particles are being collected inside the Singularity. Or does the Singularity eventually actually have to burn through the matter that's been collected when it's no longer able to collect more, so eventually it'll convert all of its captured matter into radiation and the Singularity itself dissipates as well?

My confusion stems from the fact that no one seems to give a clear answer to that. At the point they discuss the ""evaporation"" of the Black Hole they refer to it as a collective unit where as before they made a point to differentiate between the Singularity itself and the actual Event Horizon surrounding it.

ButWhoIsCounting,1486060327,5roipv,"I have a basic question about laser physics that doesn't seem to be answered in any of the standard introductory books on my shelf. 

I understand that in order to create a population inversion you need to excite transitions to a metastable state, and that the lasing occurs with stimulated emission of transitions from the metastable state. However, this seems to be a contradiction in terms, which is strangely not addressed anywhere I can find online or in my textbooks! For example, in 'Modern Physics' by Thornton &amp; Rex, they say:

""The key is that the transition from E2 to E1 must be forbidden, for example, by a Delta l = +- 1 selection rule. Then the state with energy E2 is said to be metastable.""

And then a few lines later they say that the lasing transition is the stimulated emission of exactly the previous transition they just described as ""forbidden."" And certainly the aforementioned selection rule would prevent the stimulated emission by a photon of spin 1 angular momentum, since the metastability is due to such a transition not being possible (for example the metastable state being in the 2s state, so the only lower state is 1s, so a transition would have Delta l = 0, which is not allowed).

mapf,1485469882,5qdca0,"So I was recently wondering how the actual process of weightloss works. I understand that, when you do exercise and / or dieting at the beginning your body primarily uses carbs as an energy source and when it runs out of those it starts to disintegrate muscle tissue (right?). But I mean, that's not really what you want when you want to lose weight. So when your body finally starts to burn fat it's only converting molecules at that point. You still weigh the same. So when / how do you actually *lose* it? Do you pee / poop / sweat / breathe it all out? In what form?

Also a few followup questions:

* At what point does your body switch from muscle to fat tissue? What makes it stop? Do you lose a lot of muscle when dieting or can you counteract it with exercise?
* I've heard that you can only gain fat cells but never lose them. You can only ""empty"" them. Why is that? Is it the same for muscle tissue?

Ignaddio,1485456518,5qbzbt,"I remember from an undergraduate ecology course I took in 2012 that there is an apparent deficit between projected and measured CO₂ levels in the atmosphere and oceans.

As I understand it, these projections were based on known and predicted amounts of CO₂ emissions from both anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic means as well as projected and measured rates of sequestration into terrestrial and oceanic carbon sinks, but if I recall correctly the difference between projected and measured values was massive and getting larger by the year (without any adjustment to the models).

I mean, I assume it's not just one thing. Speculating as a grad student in biochemistry (and probably over-simplifying), I wonder if it's not a Le Chatelier-like effect shifting the rate of biotic and abiotic sequestration reactions as the concentration of free CO₂/HCO₃⁻ goes up (or, alternately, an allosteric mechanism), but I assume people who specialize in that field have made efforts to account for that already.

I also remember that the [Duke Forest experiment](https://www.bnl.gov/face/) showed higher rates of carbon sequestration in a high CO₂ environment but that the soil may have been approaching limiting nitrogen conditions before the experiment was terminated.

My question is: if the iron fusion reaction was exothermic, but the temperature needed for it to occur was still out of reach of the core of a star, would it change anything ? I read a lot of explanations insisting that the endothermic nature of the iron reaction is key to the collapse, while from what I understand, it's just that iron sits there, not fusing, until the core reaches the Chandrasekar mass.  

This particular bit from the wikipedia article is confusing to me:  

&gt;The factor limiting this process is the amount of energy that is released through fusion, which is dependent on the binding energy that holds together these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively heavier nuclei, which release progressively less energy when fusing. (..) This continues until nickel-56 is produced, which decays radioactively into cobalt-56 and then iron-56 over the course of a few months.

What I don't understand is how this happens? As far as I know a proton consists of 2 up quarks and 1 down quark, and a neutron consists of 1 up quark and 2 down quarks. Wouldn't this proton+electron interaction mean that the proton would need to transform one of it's up quarks into a down quark? How can something like this just happen? 

Also, wouldn't you need more than just a proton + electron to make a neutron? When a lone neutron undergoes beta decay it becomes a proton but also releases an electron AND an electron antineutrino.

My understanding so far:

I have a 'p' doped part and an 'n' doped part. I touch them together. Both parts are neutral (in terms of charge).

Diffusion starts - free electrons go into the 'p' region and holes go into the 'n' region - this creates diffusion current

The charged particles that migrated, create voltage between the two sides so drift current starts (opposite direction with the diffusion current)

When the two currents (diffusion and drift) are equal - there is voltage between the p and n side - Fermi-levels are equalized - there is an equilibrium

**My question is how the depletion region is created in all of this?**- I know there is *recombination* too - so the concentration of the free charged particles are lowered and they leave behind charged ions ( where they came from originally)

&amp;nbsp;
First up, this is my first post so I apologise if the question is too basic or lacks enough of a basic understanding of science, but believe me that I've tried to research this online and I may have found answers but they aren't in layman's terms enough that I can comprehend them.  I'm someone who finds these concepts interesting, but I don't have any kind of background in science so there are gaping holes in my knowledge and understanding of science.  More holes then there are understandings, to be honest.  
&amp;nbsp;
This is probably a multi-phase question, too, with sub questions (which may not even be relevant to an overall answer)  
&amp;nbsp;  
**The Premise**  
Imagine that this image represents a frozen moment in time.  Imagine that we're able to move through it in an omnipresent manner to observe the ball in a 3 dimensional space without disturbing anything else (although, that may not really be necessary).  Time has continued normally before, and it will continue normally afterwards, so physics functions normally before, after and assumedly during this moment.    
&amp;nbsp;
The basic question is *""how does this ball know where it will go in the next instance in time""*.  I've specifically picked an image where external information isn't present because I'm not asking ""what is the ball's direction/trajectory/velocity/etc"", **I'm curious as to how information is passed and maintained within a body and space from moment to moment.**   
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
**Sub-questions:**  
*Note, please tell me if my line of thinking is way off.  
&amp;nbsp;  
- What part of an object holds vector information?   
- Is this information even 'held' within the object, or do those relationships occur in a constant state of reaction?   
- What parts (atomic or sub-atomic) feel the forces on it?  And how is that information transferred on to the other parts to keep the reaction occurring the way physics predicts?  
&amp;nbsp;
Unrelated Sub-question:  
- Would this image represent a unit of 'planck time'?  Since light is unable to travel within this moment (because it's frozen).

- The Sun continually burns through a fuel source that is itself


- Although it's very big, so is its ""burn"". It sends Earth enough ""heat"" to create our climate. I think Earth is apx 100 times the Sun's diameter away -- so, it's like standing in absolute zero, 100M from a fireball that's 1 metre across and being significantly heated. I.e., the output is beyond the scale of normal human experience.

- The Sun doesn't send its ""heat"" (or radiation) only in our particular direction. Any Earth-sized body 93 million miles from the sun would get an Earth-sized dose of ""sunlight"". That must mean its total ""heat"" in any moment is millions of times the heat we receive. I.e., while it's big, its ""burn"" is also big.

Someone standing still on a platform while watching a train pass by at close to *c* sees and concludes that two bolts of lightning strike the front and back of the train at the same time. Due to the fact that an observer inside the train perceives light's speed as constant regardless of direction of travel, she sees and concludes that the bolt of lightning hit the front of the train before the back of it. The order of events are different to both observers, yet both are correct for their respecitve reference frames.

**So here is my thought experiment. Suppose there is a battery at the front and rear of the train. If the front battery is struck, the train keeps going (even if both are struck at the same time). If the rear battery is struck, the train stops.**

Okay, so the observer standing still on the platform sees two bolts of lightning hit both batteries on the train. Since the front battery was hit, and this battery keeps the train going when struck with a bolt, the train keeps running regardless of the fact that the rear battery was struck.

However, an observer inside the moving train perceives the front battery being hit first, and then the rear battery being hit second. The front battery gets struck, so the train keeps running. But then the rear battery was hit *alone*, so the train must stop.

**So what happens when lighting strikes both batteries - Does the train stop or not? How does each person perceive this? How do we reconcile this?**",askscience,"Concerning the simultaneity paradox of relativity in the ""train and lightning"" example - Suppose the train has batteries in front and back of the train that dictate if it stops or goes if struck by lightning.

At every turn, however, I still have not fully understood the bridge between software and hardware.

CallMeDoc24,1484491036,5o47bb,"To my knowledge, a magnetic moment and dipole moment are simply based on the distribution of charges/currents in the particular case. Thus the 21 cm line in Hydrogen for example is magnetic dipolar because it is caused by spin interactions of the proton and electron. Thus any transitions from the excited state here would be observed to be a magnetic field (although one would still observe an electric field due to Maxwell's equations). Similarly for the 18 cm line in OH (radical), since it is due to an electric dipole (i.e. the extra unpaired electron and the nucleus), the emission from the excited to the ground state would be electric dipolar. But then I also know the 18 cm line has hyperfine transition causes by spin interactions, and so the emitted wave would have both a magnetic and electric component, correct? I was also reading:

&gt; If during the switch the atom can behave like an oscillating electric dipole, then this is usually (for visible/IR/radio radiation at least) more efficient than the oscillating magnetic dipole or electric quadrupole etc. This would be termed an electric dipole transition. However, for certain changes of quantum state, the atom cannot behave like an oscillating electric dipole and the transition can only proceed (less efficiently - often called a ""forbidden transition"" in astrophysics) by the atom behaving like an oscillating magnetic dipole - i.e. a magnetic dipole transition.

and I was wondering why it's more efficient for it to be electric dipolar as opposed to magnetic dipolar? Are not electric and magnetic fields inherently the same, and as long as they have the right frequency, wouldn't an electric field be able to bring an electron to an excited state even if it's a magnetic dipolar transition?

phlogistic,1484276991,5no3gx,"My understanding is that the second law of thermodynamics implies that the total entropy of the universe only increases over time, at least up to random decreases from statistical fluctuations.  How does one define the total entropy of the universe in an objective way?

The only definitions of entropy I'm aware of are all properties of a probability distribution rather than of a single state.  In physics, this seems to necessitate a partition of the state of a system into a fixed known macrostate, and an associated probability distribution over microstates for which the entropy is defined.  This seems like it would make the definition of entropy subjective, in that different observers might have different definitions as to the macrostate of a system, and have correspondingly (very slightly) different evaluations of its entropy.

When measuring the entropy of the entire universe, I don't understand how one can objectively partition its state into a macrostate and a microstate, since presumably *everything* is just part of one total state and there's no way to pick out just one piece and call it the macrostate.

So I guess I have two questions.

1. Is there a truly objective way to define the entropy of a physical system?  If not, is there a suitable related concept which *is* objective?
2. What is actually meant by the ""total entropy of the universe""?  Or, if it's not strictly the ""entropy"" of the universe that always increases, what property is it?

Article in question: http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2003/10/anderson.aspx

The statements that Dr. Craig Anderson make seem a little odd.

This for example: Myth 6. There are no studies linking violent video game play to serious aggression. 
Facts: High levels of violent video game exposure have been linked to delinquency, fighting at school and during free play periods, and violent criminal behavior (e.g., self-reported assault, robbery).

He doesn't really say if it's a huge reason why those acts happen or if its just a factor. Also it seems odd since last I checked there wasn't any epidemic of robberies and assault done in the name of video games. Or is it the same old, oh this person played violent video games and robbed someone/attacked someone, clearly the video games were on of the main reasons! I don't see my friends going around robbing people or attacking them. Sure some people do it, but isn't because its violent video games on top of being already mentally aggressive and having a troubled youth? Also the whole delinquency angle sounds strange to me, is there any merit to that claim outside of his own study?

Another statement he makes that I find odd: Myth 11. If violent video games cause increases in aggression, violent crime rates in the U.S. would be increasing instead of decreasing. 
Facts: Three assumptions must all be true for this myth to be valid: (a) exposure to violent media (including video games) is increasing; (b) youth violent crime rates are decreasing; (c) video game violence is the only (or the primary) factor contributing to societal violence. The first assumption is probably true. The second is not true, as reported by the 2001 Report of the Surgeon General on Youth Violence (Figure 2-7, p. 25). The third is clearly untrue. Media violence is only one of many factors that contribute to societal violence and is certainly not the most important one. Media violence researchers have repeatedly noted this.

Pay attention to this ""Media violence is only one of many factors that contribute to societal violence and is certainly not the most important one. Media violence researchers have repeatedly noted this."" He stated that video games have been linked to robbery and assault, but says it is only a small factor now. It sounds like he was trying to make video games sound WAY worse than they really are. Also what annoys me about this whole article, is that it doesn't touch on the subject of do video games directly make people violent. As in if I don't have other risk factors or I have very few, could video games alone make me into a violent person?

Anyways thanks to whoever has read this, if you are a professional on this type of stuff I would really appreciate an answer/perspective. Thanks in advance!


Edit: Another claim he made in a testimony to the senate: Myth 2. Violent media have harmful effects only on a very small minority of people who use these media. One version of this myth is commonly generated by parents who allow their children to watch violent movies and play violent games. It generally sounds like this, ""My 12 year old son watches violent TV shows, goes to violent movies, and plays violent video games, and he's never killed anyone."" Of course, most people who consume high levels of violent media, adults or youth, do not end up in prison for violent crimes. Most smokers do not die of lung cancer, either. The more relevant question is whether many (or most) people become more angry, aggressive, and violent as a result of being exposed to high levels of media violence. Are they more likely to slap a child or spouse when provoked? Are they more likely to drive aggressively, and display ""road rage?"" Are they more likely to assault co-workers? The answer is a clear yes.

Where is the evidence for this clear yes? I never slapped a child or any of my family members. I never assaulted a co-worker. Only person I ever fought were bullies who harassed me.

Using the Poisson bracket notation it is easy to achieve the equations of motion, so please try not to go in depth with the conservation of angular momentum explanation. What I don't understand is how this behaviour is consistent with Newton's equations of motion.

I will use this image in order to explain myself properly: https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/wp-content/high-res/1885-1891/gyroscope-1600.jpg

In the image, the rod can apply a force on the center of mass only in directions perpendicular to the z axis (Let z axis be normal to the surface of the Earth). We know that gravity applies a force in the ""-z"" direction. Now there should be at least two more forces that allow the system to behave like it does. Since the center of mass wont accelerate on the z axis, the total force acting on it on the z axis should be 0. Then we should have a force, lets call it force1, in the ""+z"" direction that cancels the gravitational force. Also the gyro in the image will rotate around the z axis even though it had no initial radial speed. Thus; there should also be a force, call it force2, that starts that motion and fades away as the system reaches the equilibrium state, when the gyroscope rotates with a constant angular velocity around the z axis. Do such forces as force1 and force2 exist? If they do, what type of forces they are and what are the applying agents?

My questions may be ill-stated and my assumptions preceding the questions may be wrong. I guess I'm missing something fundamental and obvious here. I may clarify any points I made if necessary, so please point out if there are any ambiguities in my argumentation. Thank you.

We would both leave the house for one to two weeks every Christmas, turning the thermostat down to something like 5C while we were away, and when we returned we would have to run the furnace full blast for about three days to get the house up to 22C again.  I would always suggest that it would be better leave the thermostat on something in the middle while were gone, like 15C, but he thought it was a waste of energy.  I argued that it took just as much energy to run the furnace continually for those three days when we returned than it did to maintain a modest temperature while we were away.  In reality, I have no idea, but I just hated those three days of feeling cold.

Obviously, this depends on lots of factors, like how cold it is outside and how long we are gone.

In fact, I'm fairly certain that cows were responsible for bubonic, not rats, and the reason the disease killed humans (which is something a virus would never want to do) was because it was used to affecting something three times as large (thanks cgp grey).

I was watching a documentary called Rats and it claims that rats can infect humans with deadly disease through something as simple as a bite.
But how does that make any sense if any other disease that originates in animals had to go through a chain of feces, blood, and corpses in order to affect humans?

So I'm laying awake and wondering about a stupid problem,

Let's say you make a coil of copper piping, spiraling upwards

Now you add a fire to the bottom of this spiral, a pile of coals at the bottom, and flames reaching the top

If you run room temperature water through this pipe,
Would you see a difference in temperature of the water depending on wether the water enters the system at the top vs the bottom? Or no difference

The bottom is hotter than the top, 
But I can't figure out if it's better to apply the most amount of heat to the water when it's coldest or after its already started to warm up... Or it doesn't make a difference because the total time and energy imparted  the water is in the pipe should be constant regardless of direction",askscience,Thermodynamics / does water heat faster if it enters at the top or bottom?
ddkyrillos,1483377474,5lmb58,"So as far as my very narrow knowledge goes, time doesn't slow down in the perspective of a particle moving near the speed of light, but for an outside observer, time is slower for that particle.

Now I understand that speed and temperature are very different things, but here's my thought process:

1. In order for a particle with mass to move near the speed of light, much energy is required. Therefore, more energy=slower time.

2. Temperature is the average kinetic energy of the particles of an object; if there's only one particle, then temperature=kinetic energy.

3. If temperature is near absolute zero, then the remaining energy would be the particle's mass and some other quantum mechanics-y stuff that I never heard of.

4. If the total energy of a particle is lower than it originally was, wouldn't time speed up, even just a bit, for that particle?

Its source is the Tibetan plateau, but the eastern and northern part of the plateau. The plateau is around 30-35 degrees north, which means it is in something of a rain shadow, but fortunately the monsoon comes up from the equator and saturates the plateau giving vast quantities of water to the Ganges, Indus and Brahmaputra rivers which gave rise to Indian civilisation. But, as we know from basic geography, rain falls on the windward side of mountains, that is, clouds come along, hit the mountains, rise, dump their water on the windward or ""first"" side of the mountains, and the leeward side gets nothing.

So, why, when the source of the Yellow river is so much farther north, after the monsoon would surely have given up all its rain, if indeed it even gets that far north (I don't think it does) and since west of the Tibetan plateau there is desert and lightly rained-on grassland, there's going to be no cloud coming in from the west to sprinkle the northern Tibetan plateau with rain... so where does all that vast amount of water come from?
